:::note

This assumes you have Talon installed. If you are new to Talon check out the Quickstart on [https://talon.wiki/](https://talon.wiki/)

import { Steps } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

<Steps>

1. Download or `git clone` this repo into your Talon user directory.
1. [Obtain an OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/signup).

1. Create a Python file anywhere in your Talon user directory.
1. Set the key environment variable within the Python file

    :::caution

    Make sure you do not push the key to a public repo!

    :::

    ```python
    # Example of setting the environment variable
    import os

    os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "YOUR-KEY-HERE"
    ```

</Steps>

### Portable CLI presets
 
Rebuild CLI recipes without retyping tokens by capturing the canonical output of `bar build`:

```bash
bar build todo focus steps fog --prompt "Draft weekly update"
bar preset save weekly-update
bar preset use weekly-update --prompt "Draft release retrospective"
```

Presets only store canonical tokens and metadata. Provide new subject text each time using `--prompt`, `--input`, or piped STDIN to avoid reusing stale context.

### Skip persona and axis stages quickly

Completions expose a skip sentinel whenever you want to jump ahead in the flow:

- `//next` hides the remaining persona hints and jumps straight to static prompt (“What”) suggestions.
- `//next:<stage>` skips a named stage such as `static`, `scope`, or `method`. Stage names appear in the completion menu so you can tab-complete them.
- Skip tokens are ignored by `bar build`, so the resulting recipe only contains the tokens you accept after the sentinel.

Combine the sentinel with normal completions to reach the sections you need faster—for example, accept `//next`, choose `todo`, then continue with axis tokens without manually clearing persona suggestions.
