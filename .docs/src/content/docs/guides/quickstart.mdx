:::note

This assumes you have Talon installed. If you are new to Talon check out the Quickstart on [https://talon.wiki/](https://talon.wiki/)

import { Steps } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

<Steps>

1. Download or `git clone` this repo into your Talon user directory.
1. [Obtain an OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/signup).

1. Create a Python file anywhere in your Talon user directory.
1. Set the key environment variable within the Python file

    :::caution

    Make sure you do not push the key to a public repo!

    :::

    ```python
    # Example of setting the environment variable
    import os

    os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "YOUR-KEY-HERE"
    ```

</Steps>

### Portable CLI presets
 
Rebuild CLI recipes without retyping tokens by capturing the canonical output of `bar build`:

```bash
bar build todo focus steps fog --prompt "Draft weekly update"
bar preset save weekly-update
bar preset use weekly-update --prompt "Draft release retrospective"
```

Presets only store canonical tokens and metadata. Provide new subject text each time using `--prompt`, `--input`, or piped STDIN to avoid reusing stale context.

### Skip persona and axis stages quickly

Completions expose a skip sentinel whenever you want to jump ahead in the flow:

- `//next` hides the remaining persona hints and jumps straight to static prompt (“What”) suggestions.
- `//next:<stage>` skips a named stage such as `static`, `scope`, or `method`. Stage names appear in the completion menu so you can tab-complete them.
- Skip tokens are ignored by `bar build`, so the resulting recipe only contains the tokens you accept after the sentinel.

Combine the sentinel with normal completions to reach the sections you need faster—for example, accept `//next`, choose `todo`, then continue with axis tokens without manually clearing persona suggestions.

### Bubble Tea prompt editor (`bar tui`)

Launch the interactive prompt editor to preview recipes while editing subjects:

```bash
bar tui todo focus steps
```

- The editor enables the terminal alt screen by default so your original buffer is restored when you exit. Pass `--no-alt-screen` if you need to capture output in the primary screen (for example, inside CI logs).
- Point at an alternate grammar with `--grammar PATH` to exercise custom prompt bundles.

For deterministic smoke tests, use the fixture harness to render a snapshot without entering the interactive loop:

```bash
bar tui --fixture "$(dirname $(command -v bar))/bar-tui_smoke.json" --no-alt-screen
```

The fixture supports the same fields described in the repository README (`tokens`, `subject`, `expected_preview`, `expected_view`, and `expect_view_contains`). Snapshot runs stream the rendered view to STDOUT, perform all assertions, and exit immediately, pairing well with the guardrail in `go test ./cmd/bar/...`.

Interactive pilots can rely on the same keyboard shortcuts mentioned in the README: `Tab` cycles between the subject input, token rail, command field, result viewport, and environment allowlist; `Ctrl+L`/`Ctrl+O` handle clipboard import/export; `Ctrl+R` pipes the preview into your configured command; `PgUp`/`PgDn`/`Home`/`End` scroll whichever viewport is focused while `Ctrl+U`/`Ctrl+D` (result viewport) half-page scroll; `Ctrl+T` toggles a condensed preview to collapse long outputs; `Ctrl+P` opens the token palette; and `Ctrl+Y` reinserts command output back into the subject buffer.
