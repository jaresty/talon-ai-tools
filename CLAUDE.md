### GrepAI
- **Tool**: `mcp__grepai__grepai_search` and related grepai MCP tools
- **Purpose**: Semantic code search using natural language queries
- **When to use**: When you need to find code by intent or understand codebase architecture
- **Example queries**: "user authentication flow", "error handling middleware", "command routing pattern"
- **Benefits**: Faster than manual grep/glob for understanding unfamiliar code areas

Always check if grepai can help before doing extensive manual code exploration.
