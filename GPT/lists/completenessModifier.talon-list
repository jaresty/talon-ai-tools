-

skim: Important: Do a very light pass; address only the most obvious or critical issues. Do not aim for completeness.
gist: Important: Provide a short but complete answer or summary; cover the main points once without going into all details.
full: Important: Provide a thorough answer for normal use; cover all major aspects, but you do not need every micro-detail.
max: Important: Be as exhaustive as is reasonable; cover essentially everything relevant and treat omissions as errors.
minimal: Important: Make the smallest change or answer that satisfies the request; avoid extra work outside the core need.
deep: Important: Go into substantial depth within the chosen scope; cover fine details without necessarily enumerating every theoretical edge case.
framework: Important: Within the chosen scope, cover all major parts of an explicit named framework or map (for example, COM-B, Wardley, Concordance); you may omit irrelevant tangents that are outside that framework.
path: Important: Describe a continuous path from the current state to a desired state, covering the key intermediate stages needed to make the transition coherent, without exhaustively detailing every micro-step.
samples: Important: Provide several diverse, self-contained options with short descriptions and explicit numeric probabilities that approximately sum to 1; avoid near-duplicate options.
