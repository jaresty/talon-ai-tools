fog: Use an abstracting, generalizing lens.
ong: Use an acting, extending lens.
rog: Use a reflective, structural lens.
dig: Use a concretizing, grounding lens.
flip: Use an inverting, skewing, or surprising lens.
flop: You must consider various angles and introduce each angle.
tap: Itemize at a very high level ideas that could be applied to this. Be terse and practical — bullets, shorthand, minimal words, fast response. Use unambiguous names so I can ask an LLM about it later. Be descriptive. Do not try to propose a solution or answer how - only answer what. You must answer in a single bulleted list limited based on the human short term memory capacity.
jog: Interpret and act. Don’t ask back — just infer the intent and carry it out directly.
