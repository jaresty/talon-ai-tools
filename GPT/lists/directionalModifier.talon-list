fog: Important: Apply an abstracting-generalizing perspective as one synthesized lens to frame the preceding prompt.
fly ong: Important: Frame the preceding prompt through one unified perspective that blends abstraction, generalization, acting, and extending. Interpret these as a single fused stance—never separate or itemize.
fly rog: Important: Frame the preceding prompt through one unified perspective that blends abstraction, generalization, reflection, and structure. Interpret these as a single fused stance—never separate or itemize.
fly bog: Important: Frame the preceding prompt through one unified perspective that blends abstraction, generalization, acting, extending, reflection, and structure. Interpret these as a single fused stance—never separate or itemize.
fig: Important: Apply an abstracting-generalizing-concretizing-grounding perspective as one synthesized lens to frame the preceding prompt.
fip ong: Important: Frame the preceding prompt through one unified perspective that blends abstraction, generalization, concreteness, grounding, acting, and extending. Interpret these as a single fused stance—never separate or itemize.

flip: Important: Frame the preceding prompt through an one unified perspective that blends inverting, skewing, or surprising perspectives. Interpret these as a single fused stance—never separate or itemize.
flop: Important: Consider various angles and introduce each angle as a distinct response. Present them separately rather than synthesizing.
tap: Important: List 5–7 high-level abstract categories with clear, unambiguous labels and a short descriptive phrase; no how-to, only what.
jog: Interpret and act. Don’t ask back — just infer the intent and carry it out directly.
