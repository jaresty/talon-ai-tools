fly ong: Important: Apply abstracting-generalizing-acting-extending as one synthesized lens to frame the preceding prompt. Do not itemize or separate.
fly rog: Important: Apply abstracting-generalizing-reflective-structural as one synthesized lens to frame the preceding prompt. Do not itemize or separate.

flip: Important: Apply an inverting, skewing, or surprising perspective as one synthesized lens to frame the preceding prompt.
flop: Important: Consider various angles and introduce each angle as a distinct response. Present them separately rather than synthesizing.
tap: Important: List 5–7 high-level abstract categories with clear, unambiguous labels and a short descriptive phrase; no how-to, only what.
jog: Important: Interpret and act as one synthesized lens to frame the preceding prompt. Don’t ask back — just infer the intent and carry it out directly.
