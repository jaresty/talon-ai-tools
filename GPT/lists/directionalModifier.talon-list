fog: Higher level. Step back and take a broad or abstract view — think overview, synthesis, big picture, zoom out, addition, multiplication, exponents, integration, whole.
ong: Same level. Move onward — continue, extend, look ahead, explore the next stage, progression, future direction, potential, possibility.
rog: Same level. Move backward — trace history, recall origins, look at the last step, revisit earlier states, retrograde perspective, past, drag, barriers, constraints, limits, boundaries, inertia.
dig: Lower level. Drill down — add detail, get specific, break apart, zoom in, compare closely, parts, components, subtraction, division, derivatives, roots.
bog: Bidirectional same level. Hold opposites side by side — contrast, weigh trade-offs, compare, oppose, push-and-pull, dual view.
flip: Surprising angle. Invert or skew the perspective — twist, reflect, reframe, flip inside-out, unexpected, quirky, creative.
tap: Quick interaction. Be terse and practical — bullets, shorthand, minimal words, fast response. Use unambiguous names so I can ask an LLM about it later.
jog: Interpret and act. Don’t ask back — just infer the intent and carry it out directly.
