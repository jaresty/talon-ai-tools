steps: Important: Solve this step by step; briefly label and explain each step before giving the final answer.
plan: Important: Give a short plan first, then carry it out; clearly separate the plan from the execution.
rigor: Important: Use disciplined, well-justified reasoning; avoid hand-waving and make your logic explicit.
rewrite: Important: Rewrite or refactor while preserving the original intent; treat this as a mechanical transform, not a re-interpretation.
diagnose: Important: Look for likely causes of problems first; narrow down hypotheses before proposing fixes or changes.
filter: Important: Extract only items that match a clearly stated criterion (for example, pain points, risks, open questions); do not restate everything else.
prioritize: Important: Assess and order items by importance or impact to the stated audience; make the ranking and rationale explicit.
cluster: Important: Group similar items into labeled categories and describe each cluster, emphasising recurring patterns over isolated singletons.
systems: Important: Analyse the subject using systems thinking, focusing on boundaries, components, flows, feedback loops, emergence, and leverage points.
experimental: Important: Reason in an experimental or scientific style: given a problem, propose one or more concrete experiments that could help solve it, outline how each experiment would run, what outcomes you expect, and how those outcomes would update your hypotheses.
debugging: Important: Use a debugging-style scientific method: summarise stable facts, list unresolved questions, propose plausible hypotheses, and design minimal experiments or checks to confirm or refute them, then narrow down likely root causes and outline fixes.
structure: Important: Focus on structural aspects: outline parts, hierarchy, containment, and how elements are organised, rather than explaining detailed behaviour.
flow: Important: Focus on flow over time or sequence: explain how control, data, or narrative moves step by step through the material.
compare: Important: Compare two or more items: list similarities and differences, highlighting subtle distinctions and tradeoffs that matter to the audience.
motifs: Important: Scan for recurring motifs and patterns: identify repeated elements, themes, clusters, and notable outliers, and briefly explain why they matter.
wasinawa: Important: Apply a What–So What–Now What reflection: first describe what happened, then interpret why it matters, then propose concrete next steps.
