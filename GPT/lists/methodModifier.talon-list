steps: Important: Solve this step by step; briefly label and explain each step before giving the final answer.
plan: Important: Give a short plan first, then carry it out; clearly separate the plan from the execution.
rigor: Important: Use disciplined, well-justified reasoning; avoid hand-waving and make your logic explicit.
rewrite: Important: Rewrite or refactor while preserving the original intent; treat this as a mechanical transform, not a re-interpretation.
diagnose: Important: Look for likely causes of problems first; narrow down hypotheses before proposing fixes or changes.
filter: Important: Extract only items that match a clearly stated criterion (for example, pain points, risks, open questions); do not restate everything else.
prioritize: Important: Assess and order items by importance or impact to the stated audience; make the ranking and rationale explicit.
cluster: Important: Group similar items into labeled categories and describe each cluster, emphasising recurring patterns over isolated singletons.
systemic: Important: Analyse the subject using systems thinking, focusing on boundaries, components, flows, feedback loops, emergence, and leverage points.
experimental: Important: Reason in an experimental or scientific style: given a problem, propose one or more concrete experiments that could help solve it, outline how each experiment would run, what outcomes you expect, and how those outcomes would update your hypotheses.
debugging: Important: Use a debugging-style scientific method: summarise stable facts, list unresolved questions, propose plausible hypotheses, and design minimal experiments or checks to confirm or refute them, then narrow down likely root causes and outline fixes.
structure: Important: Focus on structural aspects: outline parts, hierarchy, containment, and how elements are organised, rather than explaining detailed behaviour.
flow: Important: Focus on flow over time or sequence: explain how control, data, or narrative moves step by step through the material.
compare: Important: Compare two or more items: list similarities and differences, highlighting subtle distinctions and tradeoffs that matter to the audience.
motifs: Important: Scan for recurring motifs and patterns: identify repeated elements, themes, clusters, and notable outliers, and briefly explain why they matter.
wasinawa: Important: Apply a What–So What–Now What reflection: first describe what happened, then interpret why it matters, then propose concrete next steps.
ladder: Important: Use abstraction laddering: place the focal problem, then step up to higher-level causes and down to consequences, ordered by importance to the audience.
contextualise: Important: Add or reshape context to support another operation (for example, supplying background for an LLM or reframing content) without rewriting the main text itself.

deep: Important: Go into substantial depth within the chosen scope; unpack reasoning layers and fine details without necessarily enumerating every edge case.

samples: Important: Generate several diverse, self-contained options and, where appropriate, attach short descriptions and explicit numeric probabilities that approximately sum to 1; avoid near-duplicate options.

xp: Important: Use an Extreme Programming-style approach: favour very small, incremental changes; rely on working software and tests as primary feedback; and iterate with tight, collaborative feedback loops rather than big-bang plans.
adversarial: Important: Run a constructive stress-test: systematically search for weaknesses, edge cases, counterexamples, failure modes, and unstated assumptions, and prioritise critique and stress-testing over agreement while still aiming to improve the work.
case: Important: Build the case before the conclusion: lay out background, evidence, trade-offs, and alternatives first, then converge on a clear recommendation that shows how objections and constraints are addressed.
scaffold: Important: Explain with scaffolding: start from first principles, introduce ideas gradually, use concrete examples and analogies, and revisit key points so a beginner can follow and retain the concepts.
liberating: Important: Facilitate using Liberating Structures: emphasise distributed participation, short structured interactions, concrete invitations, and visual, stepwise processes; name or evoke specific LS patterns when helpful (for example, 1-2-4-All, TRIZ, 15% Solutions).
diverge: Important: Open up the option space: generate multiple, diverse possibilities or angles without prematurely judging or collapsing to a single answer.
converge: Important: Narrow down and make a call: weigh trade-offs, eliminate weaker options, and arrive at a small set of recommendations or a single decision.
mapping: Important: Emphasise mapping over exposition: surface elements, relationships, and structure; organise them into a coherent map (textual, tabular, or visual) rather than a linear narrative.
analysis: Important: Describe, analyse, and structure the situation; do not propose specific actions, fixes, or recommendations.
taxonomy: Important: Build or refine a taxonomy: define categories, subtypes, and relationships to clarify structure; prefer compact representations over prose.

socratic: Important: Use a Socratic, question-led method: advance primarily by asking short, targeted questions that surface assumptions, definitions, and gaps in understanding; hold back from giving full conclusions until enough answers are available or the user explicitly asks for a summary.

direct: Important: Lead with the main point or recommendation first, then follow with only the most relevant supporting context, evidence, and next steps.
indirect: Important: Start with brief background, reasoning, and trade-offs, then finish with a clear bottom-line point or recommendation that ties them together.
