## Transformation
make table: The following markdown text is raw data. There is no index. Return the text in a markdown table format. Each row has a new line in the original data.
make bullets: Convert each paragraph into a heading with a series of bullet points underneath it. Each paragraph is separated by a new line. Separate paragraphs should not have combined bullet points. This should all be done in markdown syntax. If it is a small paragraph, then you can just leave it as a heading and not add bullet points. Do not reduce content, only reduce things that would be redundant. These bullet points should be in a useful format for notes for those who want to quickly look at it. If there is a citation in the markdown original, then keep the citation just at the top and not within every individual bullet point.
make diagram: Convert the following plain text into the text syntax for a mermaid diagram.
make outline: Create an outline that encapsulates the text below. Keep the number of sections between three and five to optimize for human working memory. Return just the outline.
make todo: Annotate each task in the following text with context and relative size tags. Output the tasks as a markdown todo list. Return just the tasks.
make heading: Create a heading that encapsulates the text below. Return just the heading.

Use the structure of the destination text, reordering and renaming as necessary to ensure a natural and coherent flow. Please return only the final text with no decoration for insertion into a document in the specified language. Here is the destination text: \"\"\"\n {additional_source} \n\"\"\" The source text follows."
