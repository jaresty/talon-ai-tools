presenterm: "Transform the input into a valid multi-slide presenterm deck; output raw Markdown only (no code fences). Front matter exactly: \"--- newline title: <use a descriptive title based on the input, never leave blank; in the title, encode any colon ':' as &#58; and encode < and > as &lt; and &gt;> newline author: Generated (or authors: [...] ) newline date: YYYY-MM-DD newline --- newline\"; no other keys. Produce up to 12 slides (no minimum required); each slide MUST start with a Setext header (Title line, next line exactly ---), include content and references, and end with an HTML comment named end_slide on its own line with nothing else, then a blank line; the final slide MAY omit the closing end_slide. ALWAYS insert a blank line before the References section so that a line with \"References\" or \"- References\" is preceded by one empty line. Emit directives only as HTML comments on their own line with exact syntax and nothing else on the line: end_slide = \"<!-- end_slide -->\"; pause = \"<!-- pause -->\"; column_layout with weights = \"<!-- column_layout: [7, 3] -->\"; column with index = \"<!-- column: 0 -->\"; reset_layout = \"<!-- reset_layout -->\"; jump_to_middle = \"<!-- jump_to_middle -->\". CODE FENCE SAFETY: whenever a fenced code block opens (e.g., ```mermaid +render, ```bash +exec, ```latex +render, ```d2 +render), you MUST emit a matching closing fence of exactly three backticks on its own line BEFORE any non-code content, directive, or end_slide; IF a fence is still open at slide end, AUTO-EMIT the closing fence first. Support mermaid diagrams via code blocks tagged mermaid +render; support LaTeX via code blocks tagged latex +render; support D2 via code blocks tagged d2 +render; support executable snippets via fenced code blocks whose info string starts with a language then +exec (optionally +id:<name>) or +exec_replace or +image; only emit \"<!-- snippet_output: name -->\" if a snippet with +id:name exists. Hide code lines with # or /// prefixes per language; other code blocks only if relevant (name the language); images only if valid paths/URLs. HTML SAFETY IN SLIDE BODY (outside all fenced/inline code and outside HTML directives): raw HTML is NOT allowed; therefore you MUST replace EVERY literal '<' with &lt; and EVERY literal '>' with &gt; in body text (including list items and headings); NEVER output raw '<' or '>' in body text. Markdown safety in SLIDE BODY: prevent accidental styling by encoding isolated control chars unless part of valid syntax; encode every standalone or path-embedded '~' as \"&#126;\" (so \"~/foo\" becomes \"&#126;/foo\"), but keep intentional \"~~text~~\" unchanged. MERMAID SAFETY: inside mermaid code blocks, preserve Mermaid grammar and delimiters unchanged ([], (), [[]], (()), [/ /]); for NODE/EDGE LABEL TEXT you MUST wrap the entire label in ASCII double quotes and, inside that quoted text ONLY, you may encode problematic characters using **Mermaid-compatible numeric codes with NO leading ampersand**: use \"#91;\" for '[', \"#93;\" for ']', \"#40;\" for '(', \"#41;\" for ')', \"#123;\" for '{{', \"#125;\" for '}}', \"#60;\" for '<', \"#62;\" for '>', \"#35;\" for '#', and \"#58;\" for ':'; escape an internal double quote as \\\"; leave ampersands '&' and slashes '/' as-is; do not apply any other entity encodings inside labels; do not double-encode. Avoid # headers. This instruction itself must contain no literal newline characters. Talon note: every literal curly brace in this instruction is doubled (\"{{\" and \"}}\")."

# - Strategy, mapping, and dependencies
wardley: Generate a Wardley Map by identifying users, needs, and components, then output it strictly as a Markdown table where rows = visibility levels (High, Medium, Low) and columns = evolution stages (Genesis, Custom, Product, Commodity), placing components only in the cells where they belong and leaving other cells empty, and after the table provide a concise summary of dependencies and key strategic insights.
dependency: List dependencies and what they depend on.
cochange: In this situation with multiple subjects, show me how each subject directly cochanges with the others.
interact: How do these interact?
dependent: How are these dependent?
independent: How are these independent?
parallel: What problems could I have if I parallelized these two items?
team: Tell me about the team structure. Just talk about the people and their roles.
unknown: Imagine I’ve missed some critical unknown unknowns in this situation. What could they be, and how might they impact the outcome?
jim: Analyze the SUBJECT for connascence, using these definitions: Connascence = ‘a change in one element requires a change in another’; Properties—Strength (static forms usually weaker, dynamic forms stronger), Degree (number of elements affected together), Locality (closer proximity = higher locality value); compute Severity as Severity = Strength × Degree ÷ Locality; Types include: Static—Connascence of Name (CoN), Type (CoT), Position (CoP), Meaning (CoM), Algorithm (CoA); Dynamic—Execution (CoE), Timing (CoTi), Value (CoV), Identity (CoI); Strength guidance: Name≈1, Type≈2, Position≈3, Meaning≈4, Algorithm≈5, Execution≈6, Timing≈7, Value≈8, Identity≈9; For each detected instance, evaluate its Type, Strength, Degree, Locality, Severity, and illustrate with an example; then suggest remedies that reduce overall connascence in the system (not just single items), considering strategies such as moving from stronger to weaker forms, reducing Degree, improving Locality, or mitigating dynamic dependencies; include examples of how such remedies might be applied in this context, and highlight trade-offs where local strong connascence is acceptable due to high Locality.
domain: Perform a connascence-driven discovery of business domains in the SUBJECT: use connascence definitions (Connascence = ‘a change in one element requires a change in another’; Types with intrinsic Strength: Name=1, Type=2, Position=3, Meaning=4, Algorithm=5, Execution=6, Timing=7, Value=8, Identity=9; Degree = number of elements bound: D1=1–2, D2=3–4, D3=5+; Locality = L1=same function/module, L2=cross–bounded context, L3=external/public contract; Severity = Strength × Degree ÷ Locality). Group elements into domains of coupling where multiple forms of connascence converge, and describe the obligations and change scenarios that tie them together. Treat these clusters as candidate business domains or bounded contexts. For each domain, report the dominant connascence forms, supporting Severity, examples of co-change, and the business concepts implied. Highlight ≈3–5 strongest domains to keep focus. Finally, suggest remedies to strengthen boundaries (reduce Degree, improve Locality, shift to weaker connascence) and show how those remedies clarify or separate business domains, with example fixes.
tune: Evaluate this through the Concordance Frame: how visible, how broad in scope, and how volatile are the dependencies that must stay in tune for the system to remain correct?

# - Variations and playful
silly: I want you to say something silly about this.
style: Describe style instructions with one example.
recipe: Represent this as a recipe using a custom language. Include a key for how to understand the language.
problem: I want help with abstraction laddering. I have given you a problem. I want you to make a list with that in the middle. In the item above, list three answers to the question why is this a problem?. In the item below, list three answers to the question what problems does this cause?. Order the answers in decreasing importance to the audience.
lens: Given the input, create an abstract visualization that avoids diagrams or maps entirely, expressing the big picture as a loose metaphorical form (consider the input and invent an effective concept) that highlights contrasts, intensities, and points of interest, provides simple anchors for reference, and a short legend for orientation while leaving room for exploration. The output should be an SVG or code that can be run. Give instructions to view if any additional steps are required.
