how to: Quick plan to solve today’s problem.
question: Ask open ended questions about this that are important to the audience.
unknown: Imagine I’ve missed some critical unknown unknowns in this situation. What could they be, and how might they impact the outcome?
lens: Given the input, create an abstract visualization that avoids diagrams or maps entirely, expressing the big picture as a loose metaphorical form (consider the input and invent an effective concept) that highlights contrasts, intensities, and points of interest, provides simple anchors for reference, and a short legend for orientation while leaving room for exploration. The output should be an SVG or code that can be run. Give instructions to view if any additional steps are required.
presenterm: "Transform the input into a valid multi-slide presenterm deck; output raw Markdown only (no code fences). Front matter exactly: \"--- newline title: <use a descriptive title based on the input, never leave blank; in the title, encode any colon ':' as &#58; and encode < and > as &lt; and &gt;> newline author: Generated (or authors: [...] ) newline date: YYYY-MM-DD newline --- newline\"; no other keys. Produce up to 12 slides (no minimum required); each slide MUST start with a Setext header (Title line, next line exactly ---), include content and references, and end with an HTML comment named end_slide on its own line with nothing else, then a blank line; the final slide MAY omit the closing end_slide. Emit directives only as HTML comments on their own line with exact syntax and nothing else on the line: end_slide = \"<!-- end_slide -->\"; pause = \"<!-- pause -->\"; column_layout with weights = \"<!-- column_layout: [7, 3] -->\"; column with index = \"<!-- column: 0 -->\"; reset_layout = \"<!-- reset_layout -->\"; jump_to_middle = \"<!-- jump_to_middle -->\". Use bullets/prose; support mermaid diagrams via code blocks tagged mermaid +render; ALWAYS close every code block with matching triple backticks. Support LaTeX via code blocks tagged latex +render; support D2 via code blocks tagged d2 +render; support executable snippets via fenced code blocks whose info string starts with a language then +exec (optionally +id:<name>) or +exec_replace or +image; only emit \"<!-- snippet_output: name -->\" if a snippet with +id:name exists. Hide code lines with # or /// prefixes per language; other code blocks only if relevant (name the language); images only if valid paths/URLs. HTML safety in SLIDE BODY (outside all fenced/inline code and outside HTML directives): raw HTML tags are NOT allowed; therefore replace every literal '<' with &lt; and every literal '>' with &gt; in body text so examples like <img> or <link ...> appear as &lt;img&gt; or &lt;link ...&gt;. Markdown safety in SLIDE BODY: prevent accidental styling by encoding isolated control chars unless part of valid syntax; encode every standalone or path-embedded '~' as \"&#126;\" (so \"~/foo\" becomes \"&#126;/foo\"), but keep intentional \"~~text~~\" unchanged. Mermaid safety: inside mermaid code blocks, do NOT entity-encode Mermaid grammar or delimiters; for NODE and EDGE LABEL TEXT, ALWAYS wrap the label text in ASCII double quotes and, inside that quoted label text ONLY, escape any inner double quote as &quot; and any closing square bracket \"]\" as &#93;; leave ampersands \"&\" and other characters as-is; never alter shape delimiters (square/round/stadium/double-round/bracketed forms); do not double-encode. Avoid # headers. This instruction itself must contain no literal newline characters. Talon note: every literal curly brace in this instruction is doubled (\"{{\" and \"}}\")."
