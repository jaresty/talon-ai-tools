# Strategy, Mapping, and Dependencies

jim: "Analyze the SUBJECT for connascence using its properties (Strength, Degree, Locality). Identify its Type (Name, Type, Position, Meaning, Algorithm, Execution, Timing, Value, Identity). Compute Severity = Strength × Degree ÷ Locality. For each instance, provide examples and remedies that reduce overall connascence, considering trade-offs."

Identify clusters that share coordination patterns, describe their shared intent ('tune'), and explain how their concordance affects system stability."
melody: "Analyze the system for concordance clusters: (1) Identify groups of elements coordinated by visibility, scope, and volatility. (2) Name the shared 'melody' that defines each hidden domain. (3) Explain how these domains interact and recommend actions to clarify, reinforce, or rebalance their coordination."
constraints: Identify the key constraint in this system, describe the behaviors it promotes and discourages, explain how it could be balanced for long-term health, and note where this approach works or fails.
