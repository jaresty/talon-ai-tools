join: Merge into one coherent part; remove redundancy.
sort: Sort these items in order of importance to the audience.
context: Add LLM-ready context; context only.
presenterm: "Transform the input into a valid multi-slide presenterm deck; output raw Markdown only (no code fences). Front matter exactly: \"--- newline title: <use a descriptive title based on the input, never leave blank; in the title, encode any colon ':' as &#58; and encode < and > as &lt; and &gt;> newline author: Generated (or authors: [...] ) newline date: YYYY-MM-DD newline --- newline\"; no other keys. Produce up to 12 slides (no minimum required); each slide MUST start with a Setext header (Title line, next line exactly ---), include content and references, and end with an HTML comment named end_slide on its own line with nothing else, then a blank line; the final slide MAY omit the closing end_slide. ALWAYS insert a blank line before the References section so that a line with \"References\" or \"- References\" is preceded by one empty line. Emit directives only as HTML comments on their own line with exact syntax and nothing else on the line: end_slide = \"<!-- end_slide -->\"; pause = \"<!-- pause -->\"; column_layout with weights = \"<!-- column_layout: [7, 3] -->\"; column with index = \"<!-- column: 0 -->\"; reset_layout = \"<!-- reset_layout -->\"; jump_to_middle = \"<!-- jump_to_middle -->\". CODE FENCE SAFETY: whenever a fenced code block opens (e.g., ```mermaid +render, ```bash +exec, ```latex +render, ```d2 +render), you MUST emit a matching closing fence of exactly three backticks on its own line BEFORE any non-code content, directive, or end_slide; IF a fence is still open at slide end, AUTO-EMIT the closing fence first. Support mermaid diagrams via code blocks tagged mermaid +render; support LaTeX via code blocks tagged latex +render; support D2 via code blocks tagged d2 +render; support executable snippets via fenced code blocks whose info string starts with a language then +exec (optionally +id:<name>) or +exec_replace or +image; only emit \"<!-- snippet_output: name -->\" if a snippet with +id:name exists. Hide code lines with # or /// prefixes per language; other code blocks only if relevant (name the language); images only if valid paths/URLs. HTML SAFETY IN SLIDE BODY (outside all fenced/inline code and outside HTML directives): raw HTML is NOT allowed; therefore you MUST replace EVERY literal '<' with &lt; and EVERY literal '>' with &gt; in body text (including list items and headings); NEVER output raw '<' or '>' in body text. Markdown safety in SLIDE BODY: prevent accidental styling by encoding isolated control chars unless part of valid syntax; encode every standalone or path-embedded '~' as \"&#126;\" (so \"~/foo\" becomes \"&#126;/foo\"), but keep intentional \"~~text~~\" unchanged. MERMAID SAFETY: inside mermaid code blocks, preserve Mermaid grammar and delimiters unchanged ([], (), [[]], (()), [/ /]); for NODE/EDGE LABEL TEXT you MUST wrap the entire label in ASCII double quotes and, inside that quoted text ONLY, you may encode problematic characters using **Mermaid-compatible numeric codes with NO leading ampersand**: use \"#91;\" for '[', \"#93;\" for ']', \"#40;\" for '(', \"#41;\" for ')', \"#123;\" for '{{', \"#125;\" for '}}', \"#60;\" for '<', \"#62;\" for '>', \"#35;\" for '#', and \"#58;\" for ':'; escape an internal double quote as \\\"; leave ampersands '&' and slashes '/' as-is; do not apply any other entity encodings inside labels; do not double-encode. Avoid # headers. This instruction itself must contain no literal newline characters. Talon note: every literal curly brace in this instruction is doubled (\"{{\" and \"}}\")."
