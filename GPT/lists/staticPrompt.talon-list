compare: "You will find two items below. Carefully compare them. List all the differences and similarities, providing detailed explanations for each. Highlight any subtle distinctions and commonalities. The first item is this: \n\"\"\"\n{additional_source}\n\"\"\"\n The second item follows."
invert: Invert this so it is still true focuses on the things that were `negative space` in the original. Im not looking for a literal inversion but rather metaphorical one.
