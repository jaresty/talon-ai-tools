# Voice: Stakeholders and why they care

# Prompt Librarian: Prevents alias overlap; enforces clear directionality and deterministic “Return only …”.
# - Power User: Gains stable, terse suffixes and predictable behavior across workflows.
# - Facilitator/Team Lead: Ensures consistent semantics between FOG/DIG/ONG for reuse.
# - Developer/Automator: Benefits from stable names and minimal diffs for automation safety.
# Tone: Concise, operational, systems-minded
# Audience: Windsurf/Talon prompt library maintainers (power users)
# Purpose: Apply reclassifications, clarify process verbs, keep emoji variants distinct, flag minimal fixes.

# Action: Cluster, reclassify, update verbs; preserve emoji variants as distinct; minimal diffs.

# Clusters (intent/directionality)
# - FOG: Overview/abstraction; high-level; shorter outputs.
# - ONG: Forward transform; same substance; formatting/structure/tone; deterministic.
# - ROG: Reverse/offbeat; invert/undo/surprise; same substance.
# - DIG: Detail/specificity; expand; compare; concrete info.
# - TAP: Quick probe; short interactions to explore/triage.
# - JOG: Neutral reshaping; lateral; non-directional.

# FOG (overview/summary; high-level; shorter)

problem fog: I want help with abstraction laddering. I have given you a problem. I want you to make a list with that in the middle. In the item above, list three answers to the question why is this a problem?. In the item below, list three answers to the question what problems does this cause?. Order the answers in decreasing importance to the audience.
debug fog: Explore different hypotheses for this. Provide a step-by-step experiment for each hypothesis to verify or reject it.


# ONG (forward; same substance; formatting/organization/tone-only; deterministic)
joined ong: Merge into one coherent part; remove redundancy; single output only.
groups ong: Group into labeled categories; results only.
shuffled ong: Reconstruct the following text to ensure the layout is logical and significantly different from the original. Create new categories, each representing a single idea without using conjunctions like AND or OR. Present the revised text in the same language.
split ong: Separate topics into clear sections; reformatted text only.
short ong: Shorten; preserve meaning; modified text only.
flat ong: One cohesive paragraph; paragraph only.
clear ong: Add necessary context and fix grammar; modified text only; no questions.

match ong: Rewrite to match provided style; modified text only.
blend ong: "Im going to give you some source text and destination text, and I want you to modify the destination text based on the contents of the source text in a way that combines both of them together. Use the structure of the destination text, reordering and renaming as necessary to ensure a natural and coherent flow. Return only the final text with no decoration for insertion into a document in the specified language. Here is the destination text: \"\"\"\n {additional_source} \n\"\"\" The source text follows."

# ROG (reverse/offbeat; same substance, inverted or unexpected)
rog: Infer the likely prompt that produced this response.
clusters rog: Table of subtle differences among similar ideas; omit singletons; width ≤ 100 chars.
bridge rog: "Guide me to achieve the desired situation: {additional_source}, starting from the current state. The current situation is described below."
compare rog: "You will find two items below. Carefully compare them. List all the differences and similarities, providing detailed explanations for each. Highlight any subtle distinctions and commonalities. The first item is this: \n\"\"\"\n{additional_source}\n\"\"\"\n The second item follows."

# DIG (lower‑level; add specifics; expand detail/format)
dig: Make more specific; add useful details for the given situation.
emoji dig: Add emoji to improve scanability in appropriate places.
