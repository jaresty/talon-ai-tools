-

plain: Important: Use straightforward, everyday language; minimise jargon and complex sentence structures.
tight: Important: Make the answer short and dense; remove fluff and redundancy.
bullets: Important: Format the main answer as concise bullet points only; avoid long paragraphs.
table: Important: Present the main answer as a Markdown table when feasible; keep columns and rows compact.
code: Important: Output only code or markup for the main answer, with no surrounding natural-language explanation.
cards: Important: Present the main answer as a set of discrete cards or items, each with a clear heading and a short body; avoid long continuous prose.
checklist: Important: Present the main answer as an actionable checklist; each item should be a clear, imperative task rather than descriptive prose.
diagram: Important: Convert the input into appropriate Mermaid diagram code only: infer the best diagram type for the task, and respect existing Mermaid safety constraints (Mermaid diagrams do not allow parentheses in the syntax; use careful label encoding instead of raw problematic characters).
presenterm: Important: Transform the input into a valid multi-slide presenterm deck; output raw Markdown only (no code fences). Front matter exactly: "--- newline title: <use a descriptive title based on the input, never leave blank; in the title, encode any colon ':' as &#58; and encode < and > as &lt; and &gt;> newline author: Generated (or authors: [...] ) newline date: YYYY-MM-DD newline --- newline"; no other keys. Produce up to 12 slides (no minimum required); each slide MUST start with a Setext header (Title line, next line exactly ---), include content and references, and end with an HTML comment named end_slide on its own line with nothing else, then a blank line; the final slide MAY omit the closing end_slide. ALWAYS insert a blank line before the References section so that a line with "References" or "- References" is preceded by one empty line. Emit directives only as HTML comments on their own line with exact syntax and nothing else on the line: end_slide = "<!-- end_slide -->"; pause = "<!-- pause -->"; column_layout with weights = "<!-- column_layout: [7, 3] -->"; column with index = "<!-- column: 0 -->"; reset_layout = "<!-- reset_layout -->"; jump_to_middle = "<!-- jump_to_middle -->". CODE FENCE SAFETY: whenever a fenced code block opens (e.g., ```mermaid +render, ```bash +exec, ```latex +render, ```d2 +render), you MUST emit a matching closing fence of exactly three backticks on its own line BEFORE any non-code content, directive, or end_slide; IF a fence is still open at slide end, AUTO-EMIT the closing fence first. Support mermaid diagrams via code blocks tagged mermaid +render; support LaTeX via code blocks tagged latex +render; support D2 via code blocks tagged d2 +render; support executable snippets via fenced code blocks whose info string starts with a language then +exec (optionally +id:<name>) or +exec_replace or +image; only emit "<!-- snippet_output: name -->" if a snippet with +id:name exists. Hide code lines with # or /// prefixes per language; other code blocks only if relevant (name the language); images only if valid paths/URLs. HTML SAFETY IN SLIDE BODY (outside all fenced/inline code and outside HTML directives): raw HTML is NOT allowed; therefore you MUST replace EVERY literal '<' with &lt; and EVERY literal '>' with &gt; in body text (including list items and headings); NEVER output raw '<' or '>' in body text. Markdown safety in SLIDE BODY: prevent accidental styling by encoding isolated control chars unless part of valid syntax; encode every standalone or path-embedded '~' as "&#126;" (so "~/foo" becomes "&#126;/foo"), but keep intentional "~~text~~" unchanged. MERMAID SAFETY: inside mermaid code blocks, preserve Mermaid grammar and delimiters unchanged ([], (), [[]], (()), [/ /]); for NODE/EDGE LABEL TEXT you MUST wrap the entire label in ASCII double quotes and, inside that quoted text ONLY, you may encode problematic characters using Mermaid-compatible numeric codes with NO leading ampersand: use "#91;" for '[', "#93;" for ']', "#40;" for '(', "#41;" for ')', "#123;" for '{{', "#125;" for '}}', "#60;" for '<', "#62;" for '>', "#35;" for '#', and "#58;" for ':'; escape an internal double quote as \"\"; leave ampersands '&' and slashes '/' as-is; do not apply any other entity encodings inside labels; do not double-encode. Avoid # headers.
html: Important: Output only semantic HTML for the answer, with no surrounding prose.
gherkin: Important: Output only Gherkin using Jira markup where appropriate; no surrounding explanation.
shellscript: Important: Express the solution as a shell script, focusing on correct, executable shell code rather than prose.
emoji: Important: Express the answer only as emoji, omitting natural-language text.
slack: Important: Format the answer for Slack, using appropriate Markdown, mentions, and code blocks, without adding channel-irrelevant decoration.
jira: Important: Format the answer using Jira markup (headings, lists, panels) where relevant, without adding extra explanation beyond the content.
recipe: Important: Express the answer as a recipe with a custom, clearly explained mini-language plus a short key for understanding it.
abstractvisual: Important: Express the big picture as an abstract visual or metaphorical layout (for example, regions and contrasts) with a short legend and, if needed, brief SVG/code-like hints.
commit: Important: Express the answer as a conventional commit message with a short type/scope line and, if needed, a concise body.
adr: Important: Express the answer as an Architecture Decision Record (ADR) with sections for context, decision, and consequences, using a concise, document-like style.
