        "codetour": "The response is delivered as a valid VS Code CodeTour `.tour` JSON file (schema-compatible) with steps and fields appropriate to the task, omitting extra prose or surrounding explanation.",
        "diagram": "The response converts the input into Mermaid diagram code only: it infers the best diagram type for the task and respects Mermaid safety constraints (Mermaid diagrams do not allow parentheses in the syntax or raw '|' characters inside node labels; the text uses numeric encodings such as \"#124;\" for '|' instead of raw problematic characters).",
        "gherkin": "The response outputs only Gherkin format as the complete output, using Jira markup where appropriate and omitting surrounding explanation.",
        "html": "The response consists solely of semantic HTML as the complete output, with no surrounding prose or explanation.",
        "jira": "The response formats the content using Jira markup (headings, lists, panels) where relevant and avoids extra explanation beyond the main material.",
        "plain": "The response uses plain prose with natural paragraphs and sentences as the delivery format, imposing no additional structural conventions such as bullets, tables, or code blocks.",
        "presenterm": "The response is a valid multi-slide presenterm deck expressed as raw Markdown (no code fences). The front matter always matches: \"--- newline title: <descriptive title based on the input with colons encoded as &#58; and angle brackets encoded as &lt; and &gt;> newline author: Generated (or authors: [...]) newline date: YYYY-MM-DD newline --- newline\" with no other keys. The deck contains up to 12 slides. Each slide starts with a Setext header (title line followed by a line of ---), includes content and references, and ends with an HTML comment named end_slide on its own line followed by a blank line; the final slide may omit the closing end_slide. A blank line always precedes the References section so that a line with \"References\" or \"- References\" is separated by one empty line. Directives appear only as standalone HTML comments with exact syntax: \"<!-- end_slide -->\", \"<!-- pause -->\", \"<!-- column_layout: [7, 3] -->\", \"<!-- column: 0 -->\", \"<!-- reset_layout -->\", and \"<!-- jump_to_middle -->\". Code fence safety is enforced: whenever a fenced code block opens (for example ```mermaid +render, ```bash +exec, ```latex +render, ```d2 +render), the response includes a matching closing fence of exactly three backticks on its own line before any non-code content, directive, or end_slide; if a fence remains open at slide end, the response emits the closing fence first. Mermaid diagrams use code blocks tagged mermaid +render; LaTeX uses latex +render; D2 uses d2 +render; executable snippets use fenced code blocks whose info string starts with a language then +exec (optionally +id:<name>) or +exec_replace or +image. The response emits \"<!-- snippet_output: name -->\" only when a snippet with +id:name exists. Lines hidden with # or /// prefixes follow language conventions; other code blocks appear only when relevant and include the language name; images appear only when valid paths or URLs exist. Within the slide body (outside fenced or inline code and outside HTML directives), the deck never includes raw HTML: every literal '<' becomes &lt; and every literal '>' becomes &gt;, preventing raw angle brackets in body text. Markdown safety prevents accidental styling: standalone or path-embedded '~' becomes \"&#126;\" (so \"~/foo\" becomes \"&#126;/foo\") while intentional \"~~text~~\" remains unchanged. Mermaid safety keeps grammar and delimiters intact ([], (), [[]], (()), [/ /]); node and edge labels appear inside ASCII double quotes and use Mermaid-compatible numeric codes with no leading ampersand, such as \"#91;\" for \"[\", \"#93;\" for \"]\", \"#40;\" for \"(\", \"#41;\" for \")\", \"#123;\" for \"{{\", \"#125;\" for \"}}\", \"#60;\" for \"<\", \"#62;\" for \">\", \"#35;\" for \"#\", \"#58;\" for \":\", and \"&\" and slashes '/' remain as-is, with no additional entity encodings, and labels are never double-encoded. The deck avoids # headers in slide bodies.",

The response must use valid D2 syntax and only documented D2 shapes (e.g., rectangle, circle, cylinder, diamond, hexagon, cloud, text). To create visually distinct boxes, use 'border-radius' or style attributes instead of non-existent shapes like 'rounded' or 'note'. Explanatory or note-like content must be modeled using shape: text or a styled standard shape. Do not include any surrounding natural language or commentary. Ensure the output is syntactically correct and compiles successfully with the D2 CLI.",
