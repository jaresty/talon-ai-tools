    Identified that `history-guardrail-checklist.py` and related tests/targets operate in a fresh Python process, never reading Talon’s live `requestLog`, so they provide no telemetry preservation value in the solo workflow.
- green | 2025-12-21T22:08Z | n/a | decision
    Recorded ADR-0056 work-log Loop 277 documenting the intent to remove the helper and audit other automation assumptions.
