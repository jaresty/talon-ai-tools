- red | 2025-12-22T18:18Z | exit n/a | No pre-existing guardrail covers GitHub workflow artefact uploads; automation gap documented in ADR log.
- green | 2025-12-22T18:20Z | exit 0 | `python3 -m pytest _tests/test_run_guardrails_ci.py::RunGuardrailsCITests::test_run_guardrails_ci_history_target_produces_summary`
  - excerpt:
    ```
    _tests/test_run_guardrails_ci.py .                                       [100%]

- removal | 2025-12-22T18:21Z | exit n/a | `git checkout -- .github/workflows/test.yml`
  - note: Reverting the workflow drops the new skip-summary upload, causing CI guardrail runs to continue omitting skip telemetry. Reapply the patch to restore compliance.
