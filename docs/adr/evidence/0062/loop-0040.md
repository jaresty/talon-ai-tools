- helper_version: helper:v20251223.1
- focus: ADR-0062 – scope remaining orchestrator tasks post metadata loops
- riskiest_assumption: Without re-triaging the Refactor Plan after loops 0034–0036, subsequent work might duplicate effort or miss priority areas (probability medium, impact medium on coordination).
- validation_targets: (informational planning loop; no commands executed)
- summary: Logged updated scope in work log; next loop captures characterization tests.
- residual_risks: Execution risk remains until characterization tests are in place.
