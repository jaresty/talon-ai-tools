- helper_version: helper:v20251223.1
- focus: ADR-0062 – identify missing characterization tests before persona/catalog migrations
- riskiest_assumption: Persona/catalog refactors could regress behaviour without targeted tests (probability medium, impact high on Concordance stability).
- validation_targets: (informational loop; no commands executed)
- summary: Documented candidate tests for persona orchestrator, guidance surface coordinator, and history lifecycle façade.
- residual_risks: Tests still need to be authored alongside refactor loops.
