- helper_version: helper:v20251223.1
- focus: ADR-0062 §Refactor Plan – Prompt Persona Orchestrator (characterization tests)
- riskiest_assumption: Persona catalog refactor could regress spoken alias and axis token expectations without dedicated tests (probability medium, impact high on guidance/doc consistency).
- validation_targets:
  - python3 -m pytest _tests/test_persona_catalog.py
- evidence:
  - green | 2025-12-25T21:12:04Z | exit 0 | python3 -m pytest _tests/test_persona_catalog.py
    - helper:diff-snapshot=1 file added (`_tests/test_persona_catalog.py`)
    - pointer: inline — `2 passed`
- rollback_plan: git rm _tests/test_persona_catalog.py && python3 -m pytest _tests/test_help_hub.py
- delta_summary: helper:diff-snapshot=1 file added; new characterization tests cover persona spoken map, axis tokens, and intent display mappings ahead of facade refactors.
- residual_risks:
  - Tests currently assert a subset of catalog invariants; additional coverage may be needed when new persona presets are introduced.
- next_work:
  - Behaviour: introduce persona catalog façade consumed by GPT/help surfaces — Loop 044.
