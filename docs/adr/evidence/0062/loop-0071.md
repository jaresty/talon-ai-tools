- helper_version: helper:v20251223.1
- focus: ADR-0062 §Refactor Plan – History Lifecycle Orchestrator (final audit of requestState imports)
- riskiest_assumption: Additional modules might still import `requestState` directly, undermining façade ownership (probability low, impact low).
- validation_targets:
  - *Audit only*
- evidence:
  - green | 2025-12-26T02:08:20Z | audit | rg "from \\'.requestState" lib
    - helper:diff-snapshot=0 files changed
    - pointer: remaining direct imports limited to `requestLog` (DropReason serialization) and `historyLifecycle` façade itself.
- rollback_plan: git restore --source=HEAD -- docs/adr/evidence/0062/loop-0071.md docs/adr/0062-canonicalize-gpt-surface-orchestrators.work-log.md
- delta_summary: Documented final audit confirming façade coverage; no code changes required.
- residual_risks:
  - `requestLog` still relies on `RequestDropReason`; revisit if façade ever wraps logging internals.
- next_work:
  - Behaviour: proceed with ADR-0062 follow-ups (persona orchestrator, guidance coordinator) as described in salient tasks.
