- helper_version: helper:v20251223.1
- focus: ADR-0062 §Refactor Plan – History Lifecycle Orchestrator (audit remaining `requestLog` test usage)
- riskiest_assumption: Residual test suites still rely on `requestLog`, risking drift from the lifecycle façade (probability medium, impact medium).
- validation_targets:
  - rg "from talon_user.lib import requestLog" _tests
  - rg "talon_user.lib.requestLog" _tests
- evidence:
  - green | 2025-12-26T17:22:10Z | exit 0 | rg "from talon_user.lib import requestLog" _tests
    - helper:diff-snapshot=0 files changed
    - pointer: inline — matches limited to request history drawer tests
  - green | 2025-12-26T17:22:24Z | exit 0 | rg "talon_user.lib.requestLog" _tests
    - helper:diff-snapshot=0 files changed
    - pointer: inline — remaining consumers include GPT actions, request history actions/drawer, request log axis filter, and request log unit tests slated for future migration
- rollback_plan: *(audit only; no code changes applied)*
- delta_summary: Documented outstanding test suites still importing `requestLog` directly to guide future façade migrations.
- residual_risks:
  - High-touch suites (request history drawer/actions, request log axis filter) still depend on `requestLog`; expect additional façade adapters to be required.
- next_work:
  - Behaviour: prioritise migrating request history actions/drawer tests to `historyLifecycle` helpers.
