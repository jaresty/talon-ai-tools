- helper_version: helper:v20251223.1
- focus: ADR-0063 §Implementation Plan – Shared Command Grammar Assets & Go CLI Core (loop scaffolding)
- riskiest_assumption: Without establishing loop scaffolding and evidence path, initial CLI consolidation work lacks observability and could diverge from ADR guardrails (probability medium, impact medium-high on governance).
- validation_targets:
  - *Planning loop — validation deferred to implementation slice*
- evidence:
  - green | 2026-01-01T00:05:00Z | N/A | (documentation update)
    - helper:diff-snapshot=2 files changed, 43 insertions(+)
    - pointer: inline — recorded loop contract and next behaviours for ADR-0063.
- rollback_plan: git restore --source=HEAD -- docs/adr/0063-go-cli-single-source-of-truth.work-log.md docs/adr/evidence/0063/loop-0001.md
- delta_summary: helper:diff-snapshot=2 files changed, 43 insertions(+); captured initial work-log entry and evidence template for ADR-0063 to keep future loops auditable.
- loops_remaining_forecast: 3 loops remaining (CLI scaffolding docs, shared schema docs, parity audit); confidence medium.
- residual_risks:
  - Pending CLI scaffolding and schema assets remain undefined; mitigation: author initial documentation slices in upcoming loops.
- next_work:
  - Behaviour: establish CLI scaffolding documents per ADR-0063 Implementation Plan §2 — python3 - <<'PY'
      from pathlib import Path
      text = Path('cli/README.md').read_text()
      if 'Go CLI single source of truth' not in text:
          raise SystemExit(1)
      print('CLI README mentions shared source of truth')
    PY — future-shaping: ensure CLI directions reference shared schema assets.
