- helper_version: helper:v20251223.1
- focus: ADR-0063 §Shared Contracts & Parity Guidance – CLI↔Talon parity audit (blocker capture)
- riskiest_assumption: Without a built CLI binary, cross-runtime parity checks cannot execute, leaving shared schema assets unvalidated against Go entry points (probability high, impact high on parity guarantees).
- validation_targets:
  - python3 - <<'PY'
      from pathlib import Path
      binary = Path('cli/bin/talon')
      if not binary.exists():
          raise SystemExit('missing CLI binary at cli/bin/talon')
      print('Found CLI binary for parity audit')
    PY
- evidence:
  - red | 2026-01-01T08:48:08Z | exit 1 | python3 - <<'PY'
      from pathlib import Path
      binary = Path('cli/bin/talon')
      if not binary.exists():
          raise SystemExit('missing CLI binary at cli/bin/talon')
      print('Found CLI binary for parity audit')
    PY
    - helper:diff-snapshot=0 files changed
    - pointer: inline — command exits with "missing CLI binary at cli/bin/talon", blocking parity execution.
- rollback_plan: N/A — parity audit blocked pending CLI binary build; rerun validation target once the CLI is compiled.
- delta_summary: helper:diff-snapshot=1 file changed, 17 insertions(+); recorded blocker evidence for the CLI parity audit, no behavioural changes landed.
- loops_remaining_forecast: 1 loop remaining (build CLI + parity audit); confidence medium-low until binary exists.
- residual_risks:
  - CLI binary not yet built; mitigation: implement Go build pipeline and integrate with Talon adapters before rerunning parity.
- next_work:
  - Behaviour: produce CLI binary and rerun parity audit — `go build ./cli/... && python3 -m pytest _tests/test_axis_catalog_serializer.py _tests/test_gpt_axis_catalog_fallback.py` — future-shaping: ensure parity harness executes against compiled CLI outputs.
