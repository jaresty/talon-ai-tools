- helper_version: helper:v20251223.1
- focus: ADR-0063 §Implementation Plan – Go CLI Core (bootstrap `bar` binary)
- riskiest_assumption: Without a compiled `bar` binary, Talon cannot delegate to the Go CLI and parity guardrails remain blocked (probability high, impact high on cross-runtime alignment).
- validation_targets:
  - go build -o bin/bar ./cmd/bar (run from `cli/`)
- evidence:
  - red | 2026-01-01T15:34:18Z | exit 1 | go build ./cli/...
    - helper:diff-snapshot=0 files changed
    - pointer: inline — `pattern ./cli/...: directory prefix cli does not contain main module or its selected dependencies`
  - green | 2026-01-01T15:40:16Z | exit 0 | go build -o bin/bar ./cmd/bar
    - helper:diff-snapshot=4 files changed, 48 insertions(+), 6 deletions(-)
    - pointer: inline — command succeeds and emits the `bar` binary under `cli/bin/bar`.
  - removal | 2026-01-01T15:38:18Z | exit 1 | mv go.mod go.mod.tmp && go build -o bin/bar ./cmd/bar; mv go.mod.tmp go.mod
    - helper:diff-snapshot=0 files changed
    - pointer: inline — temporary removal of `go.mod` reproduces the "cannot find main module" failure.
- rollback_plan: (cd cli && mv go.mod go.mod.tmp && go build -o bin/bar ./cmd/bar); (cd cli && mv go.mod.tmp go.mod)
- delta_summary: helper:diff-snapshot=4 files changed, 48 insertions(+), 6 deletions(-); added Go module scaffolding and a minimal `bar` command to unblock parity testing.
- loops_remaining_forecast: 1 loop remaining (run parity guardrails with compiled `bar`); confidence medium.
- residual_risks:
  - CLI currently emits help/version only; behaviour wiring to shared schema assets is deferred to future loops.
- next_work:
  - Behaviour: run parity guardrails now that `bar` builds — go build -o bin/bar ./cmd/bar && python3 -m pytest _tests/test_axis_catalog_serializer.py _tests/test_gpt_axis_catalog_fallback.py — future-shaping: execute guardrails against the compiled CLI.
