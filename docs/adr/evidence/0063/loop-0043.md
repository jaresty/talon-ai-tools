## metadata
- helper_version: helper:v20251223.1
- focus: Implementation Guardrails → Delivery posture — surface telemetry recovery prompts through provider canvases (`python3 -m pytest _tests/test_cli_talon_parity.py`)
- riskiest_assumption: If CLI recovery keeps only resetting internal flags without notifying operators, Talon will stay frozen on stale drop reasons and providers will never signal that delegation is healthy again.
- validation_targets:
  - `python3 -m pytest _tests/test_cli_talon_parity.py`
- rollback_plan: `git restore --source=HEAD _tests/test_cli_talon_parity.py lib/cliDelegation.py lib/providerCommands.py lib/providerRegistry.py lib/requestLog.py` then rerun the parity command to confirm the failure returns.
- delta_summary: helper:diff-snapshot=5 files changed, 357 insertions(+), 22 deletions(-) — add recovery prompts/tests, extend delegation state, expose provider canvas handler, and update registry messaging.
- loops_remaining_forecast:
  - 1 loop — Thread recovery signals into history telemetry dashboards and manual recovery workflows (`python3 -m pytest _tests/test_cli_talon_parity.py`), confidence medium.
  - 1 loop — Aggregate signing key drift into release guardrails (`python3 scripts/tools/check_cli_assets.py`), confidence medium.
- residual_risks:
  - History timeline still lacks explicit recovery entries (severity medium). Mitigation: next slice mirrors recovery prompts into history telemetry and monitors drop reason resets; reopen if parity test logs lose recovery evidence.
- next_work:
  - Behaviour: Replace stubbed CLI delegation with real binary — propagate recovery telemetry into history and manual recovery scripting (`python3 -m pytest _tests/test_cli_talon_parity.py`).
  - Behaviour: Harden release pipeline with checksum manifest — fold recovery snapshots into signing telemetry drift checks (`python3 scripts/tools/check_cli_assets.py`).
