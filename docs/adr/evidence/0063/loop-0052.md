- loops_remaining_forecast:
  - 1 loop — Verify CI automation uploads telemetry bundle (`python3 scripts/tools/check_cli_assets.py`), confidence medium.
- residual_risks:
  - CI automation still pending (severity medium). Mitigation: follow next loop to integrate upload into pipelines; monitor release logs for `ci_signature_telemetry_export` output.
- next_work:
  - Behaviour: Harden release pipeline with checksum manifest — integrate CI upload of telemetry bundle (`python3 scripts/tools/check_cli_assets.py`).

## Release Telemetry Export — Operator Workflow
1. Run `python3 scripts/tools/check_cli_assets.py --repackage-on-recovery-drift` as part of the release checklist. The guard writes the refreshed telemetry to `artifacts/cli/signature-telemetry.json` and prints `ci_signature_telemetry_export=…` with the final path.
2. Upload the following artefacts to the release bundle / CI artefact store:
   - CLI tarball and manifest/signature
   - `artifacts/cli/signatures.json`
   - `artifacts/cli/signature-telemetry.json` (new telemetry bundle)
3. Record completion in the release notes (example snippet):
   ```
   - [ ] Uploaded refreshed CLI signature telemetry bundle (`artifacts/cli/signature-telemetry.json`)
   ```
4. If the guard reports a telemetry mismatch, rerun the release packaging script (`python3 scripts/tools/package_bar_cli.py --print-paths`) and repeat steps 1–3 until green.
