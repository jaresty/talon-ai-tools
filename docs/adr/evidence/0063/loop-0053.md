- helper_version: helper:v20251223.1
- focus: Implementation Guardrails → Delivery posture — automate CI upload of signature telemetry bundle
- riskiest_assumption: Without CI automation, the refreshed telemetry bundle might never leave the build agent, leaving downstream releases with stale recovery prompts despite green guardrails.
- validation_targets: [] (workflow-only change)
- rollback_plan: `git restore --source=HEAD .github/workflows/test.yml docs/adr/0063-go-cli-single-source-of-truth.work-log.md docs/adr/evidence/0063/loop-0053.md`
- delta_summary: helper:diff-snapshot=3 files changed, 32 insertions(+), 1 deletion(-) — add GitHub Actions artifact upload step plus log the loop and evidence entry.
- loops_remaining_forecast:
  - 1 loop — Observe release telemetry runs and capture evidence of successful bundle uploads (documentation), confidence medium.
- residual_risks:
  - Artifact upload relies on `make ci-guardrails` producing `artifacts/cli/signature-telemetry.json`. Monitor CI for warnings when the file is absent.
- next_work:
  - Behaviour: Harden release pipeline with checksum manifest — capture CI run evidence confirming telemetry bundle upload (documentation-only).

## Notes
- Updated `.github/workflows/test.yml` to call `actions/upload-artifact@v4`, uploading `artifacts/cli/signature-telemetry.json` after guardrails/tests with `if-no-files-found: warn`. This ensures release pipelines publish refreshed telemetry.
- Work-log entry now records loop-0053 completion and points the next slice at monitoring CI runs.
