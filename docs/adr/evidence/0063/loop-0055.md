- helper_version: helper:v20251223.1
- focus: Implementation Guardrails → Delivery posture — ensure CI runs CLI asset guard before uploading telemetry bundle
- riskiest_assumption: Without running `check_cli_assets.py --repackage-on-recovery-drift`, the CI job might upload a stale or missing telemetry bundle.
- validation_targets: [] (workflow-only change)
- rollback_plan: `git restore --source=HEAD .github/workflows/test.yml docs/adr/0063-go-cli-single-source-of-truth.work-log.md docs/adr/evidence/0063/loop-0055.md`
- delta_summary: helper:diff-snapshot=3 files changed, 25 insertions(+), 2 deletions(-) — add CI step to execute `check_cli_assets.py --repackage-on-recovery-drift`, update work-log, and record this loop’s evidence.
- loops_remaining_forecast:
  - 1 loop — Capture CI run artefact confirming telemetry upload (documentation-only), confidence medium.
- residual_risks:
  - CI still needs an end-to-end run to prove the artefact appears in the Actions UI.
- next_work:
  - Behaviour: Harden release pipeline with checksum manifest — document CI artefact evidence once run completes.

## Notes
- `.github/workflows/test.yml` now runs `python3 scripts/tools/check_cli_assets.py --repackage-on-recovery-drift` immediately after `make ci-guardrails`, guaranteeing the telemetry bundle is regenerated before the upload step.
- Upload step remains with `if: always()` so artefacts are published even when earlier steps fail.
