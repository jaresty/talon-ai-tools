## loop-006 analysis
- Reviewed ADR 0064 after loop 005 and noted the context did not explicitly mention the gaps (missing shared hydrator, ambiguous passive guard semantics) that the plan now requires closing.
- Added a clarifying bullet to the ADR context so future contributors understand why the new deliverables exist before implementation begins.
