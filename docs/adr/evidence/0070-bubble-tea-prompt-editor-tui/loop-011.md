- excerpt (truncated):
  ```diff
-- Publish a lightweight quickstart note (key bindings, known limitations, quit path) so you can reference the workflow quickly during trials.
-- Capture your feedback after each session and triage follow-on work (completions refresh, telemetry, advanced layout) into the backlog when the MVP holds up.
- ...
-- Prepare personal enablement: document the MVP workflow, outline known gaps (completions, telemetry, advanced panes), and set up a simple feedback loop for yourself.
  ```
