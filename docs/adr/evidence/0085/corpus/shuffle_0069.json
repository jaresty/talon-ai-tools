    "Completeness (\"max\"): The response is as exhaustive as reasonable, covering essentially everything relevant and treating omissions as errors.",

Claims that fail any axis are treated as ungrounded and must not be synthesized into conclusions or recommendations, ensuring outputs do not transfer authority or imply trust beyond the model. This prevents internally coherent but unconstrained narratives and preserves human oversight as the source of judgment.",

    "Channel (\"gherkin\"): The response outputs only Gherkin format as the complete output, using Jira markup where appropriate and omitting surrounding explanation. Appropriate for tasks that map naturally to scenario-based behavior specification: `check` for acceptance criteria, `plan` for BDD-style feature planning, `make` when defining system behavior. Not appropriate for tasks that don't involve system behavior: `sort`, `sim`, `probe`, `diff` (without behavioral subject)."
