    "Completeness (\"full\"): The response provides a thorough answer for normal use, covering all major aspects without needing every micro-detail.",
    "Method (\"mod\"): The response enhances the task by applying modulo-style reasoning—equivalence classes, cyclic patterns, quotient structures, or periodic behavior that repeats with a defined period or wraps around boundaries.",
    "Channel (\"sketch\"): The response emits only pure D2 diagram source as the complete output. The response must use valid D2 syntax and only documented D2 shapes (e.g., rectangle, circle, cylinder, diamond, hexagon, cloud, text). To create visually distinct boxes, use 'border-radius' or style attributes instead of non-existent shapes like 'rounded' or 'note'. Explanatory or note-like content must be modeled using shape: text or a styled standard shape. Do not include any surrounding natural language or commentary. Ensure the output is syntactically correct and compiles successfully with the D2 CLI."
