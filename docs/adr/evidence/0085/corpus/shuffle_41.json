    "Completeness (\"deep\"): The response goes into substantial depth within the chosen scope, unpacking reasoning layers and fine details without necessarily enumerating every edge case.",

    "Form (\"scaffold\"): The response explains with scaffolding: it starts from first principles, introduces ideas gradually, uses concrete examples and analogies, and revisits key points so a learner can follow and retain the concepts. Most effective with learning-oriented audiences (student, entry-level engineer). May conflict with expert-level or brevity-first personas where first-principles exposition contradicts assumed expertise."
