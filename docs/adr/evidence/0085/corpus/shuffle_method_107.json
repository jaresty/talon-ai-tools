  "task": "Task:\n  The response selects or extracts a subset of the given information without altering its substance.",
  "constraints": [
    "Completeness (\"max\"): The response is as exhaustive as reasonable, covering essentially everything relevant and treating omissions as errors.",
    "Scope (\"motifs\"): The response focuses on recurring structural or thematic forms that appear in multiple places, identifying repeated configurations or isomorphic patterns without analyzing their internal topology in detail or their boundary-spanning distribution.",
    "Method (\"order\"): The response enhances the task by applying abstract structural reasoning such as hierarchy, dominance, or recurrence. When paired with `sort` task, `order` adds emphasis on the criteria and scheme driving the sequencing rather than merely producing the sorted result — consider whether the distinction is needed.",
    "Form (\"quiz\"): The response organizes content as a quiz structure — questions posed before explanations, testing understanding through active recall before providing answers. Without an output-exclusive channel, conducts this as an interactive exchange: poses questions, waits for responses, then clarifies or deepens. With an output-exclusive channel, structures the output itself as a quiz — question headings with revealed answers, test sections, knowledge checks — without requiring live interaction.",
    "Channel (\"presenterm\"): The response is a valid multi-slide presenterm deck expressed as raw Markdown (no code fences). The front matter always matches: \"--- newline title: \u003cdescriptive title based on the input with colons encoded as \u0026#58; and angle brackets encoded as \u0026lt; and \u0026gt;\u003e newline author: Generated (or authors: [...]) newline date: YYYY-MM-DD newline --- newline\" with no other keys. The deck contains up to 12 slides. Each slide starts with a Setext header (title line followed by a line of ---), includes content and references, and ends with an HTML comment named end_slide on its own line followed by a blank line; the final slide may omit the closing end_slide. A blank line always precedes the References section so that a line with \"References\" or \"- References\" is separated by one empty line. Directives appear only as standalone HTML comments with exact syntax: \"\u003c!-- end_slide --\u003e\", \"\u003c!-- pause --\u003e\", \"\u003c!-- column_layout: [7, 3] --\u003e\", \"\u003c!-- column: 0 --\u003e\", \"\u003c!-- reset_layout --\u003e\", and \"\u003c!-- jump_to_middle --\u003e\". Code fence safety is enforced: whenever a fenced code block opens (for example ```mermaid +render, ```bash +exec, ```latex +render, ```d2 +render), the response includes a matching closing fence of exactly three backticks on its own line before any non-code content, directive, or end_slide; if a fence remains open at slide end, the response emits the closing fence first. Mermaid diagrams use code blocks tagged mermaid +render; LaTeX uses latex +render; D2 uses d2 +render; executable snippets use fenced code blocks whose info string starts with a language then +exec (optionally +id:\u003cname\u003e) or +exec_replace or +image. The response emits \"\u003c!-- snippet_output: name --\u003e\" only when a snippet with +id:name exists. Lines hidden with # or /// prefixes follow language conventions; other code blocks appear only when relevant and include the language name; images appear only when valid paths or URLs exist. Within the slide body (outside fenced or inline code and outside HTML directives), the deck never includes raw HTML: every literal '\u003c' becomes \u0026lt; and every literal '\u003e' becomes \u0026gt;, preventing raw angle brackets in body text. Markdown safety prevents accidental styling: standalone or path-embedded '~' becomes \"\u0026#126;\" (so \"~/foo\" becomes \"\u0026#126;/foo\") while intentional \"~~text~~\" remains unchanged. Mermaid safety keeps grammar and delimiters intact ([], (), [[]], (()), [/ /]); node and edge labels appear inside ASCII double quotes and use Mermaid-compatible numeric codes with no leading ampersand, such as \"#91;\" for \"[\", \"#93;\" for \"]\", \"#40;\" for \"(\", \"#41;\" for \")\", \"#123;\" for \"{{\", \"#125;\" for \"}}\", \"#60;\" for \"\u003c\", \"#62;\" for \"\u003e\", \"#35;\" for \"#\", \"#58;\" for \":\", and \"\u0026\" and slashes '/' remain as-is, with no additional entity encodings, and labels are never double-encoded. The deck avoids # headers in slide bodies.",
    "Directional (\"fog\"): The response modifies the task to identify general patterns and abstract principles from the specifics, moving from particular cases to broader insights."
