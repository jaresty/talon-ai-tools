    "Method (\"verify\"): The response enhances the task by applying falsification pressure to claims, requiring causal chain integrity, externally imposed constraints, and explicitly defined negative space. Claims that fail any axis are treated as ungrounded and must not be synthesized into conclusions or recommendations, ensuring outputs do not transfer authority or imply trust beyond the model. This prevents internally coherent but unconstrained narratives and preserves human oversight as the source of judgment.",

With sort/plan: asks clarifying questions about criteria before producing output. With make/fix: asks diagnostic questions then provides the solution. With probe: naturally extends to deeper inquiry.",
