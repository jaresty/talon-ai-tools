## Shuffle Seed 1 — Evaluation

**Generated Prompt:**
- Task: pull (subset extraction)
- Completeness: minimal
- Scope: cross (concerns spanning modules)
- Form: spike (research spike)
- Channel: sync (live session)
- Directional: fig (figure-ground reversal)
- Persona: to Kent Beck

### Evaluation Scores

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Task clarity | 4 | pull = "extract subset" — clear |
| Constraint independence | 4 | Constraints shape HOW (spike format, sync delivery, fig style) |
| Persona coherence | 3 | Kent Beck + spike + sync — test-minded but sync is unusual for Beck |
| Category alignment | 5 | All tokens in correct axes |
| Combination harmony | 3 | cross + minimal + spike: cross wants thoroughness, minimal wants brevity — slight tension |
| **Overall** | **4** | **Good — minor tension between cross and minimal.** |

### Analysis

**Coherence check:**
- `pull` (extract) + `cross` (spanning) = extract cross-cutting concerns ✅
- `minimal` + `cross` = slight tension: cross wants thorough examination, minimal wants minimal work ⚠️
- `spike` + `sync` = research spike delivered as live session — unusual but possible
- `fig` + Kent Beck = abstract↔concrete alternation fits Beck's style ✅

**Finding:** `cross` scope token (R-01) working in shuffle context! Appears naturally in combinations.

### Meta-Evaluation vs Skills

**Would bar-autopilot select this?**
- Unlikely — combination is unusual (research spike for Kent Beck about cross-cutting concerns)
- Skills don't have explicit guidance for this niche combo
- But tokens are discoverable via `bar help llm`

**Skill alignment:** 3/5 — Valid combo, not commonly guided
