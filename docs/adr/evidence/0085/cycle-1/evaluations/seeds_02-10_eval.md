**Evaluation Summary:**

| Seed | Task | Completeness | Scope/Method | Form/Channel | Directional | Persona | Score | Notes |
|------|------|--------------|--------------|--------------|-------------|---------|-------|-------|
| 2 | pull | skim | domains | log | — | — | 4 | Minimal but coherent |
| 3 | show | gist | fail+product | — | jira | fly ong | 4 | Product lens on failures — interesting combo |
| 4 | show | full | assume | — | — | team | 5 | Clean teaching combo |
| 5 | probe | full | cross+melody | sync | fip rog | — | 5 | cross+melody work well together |
| 6 | sim | full | thing | codetour | — | new hire | 4 | Simulation via codetour — unusual but possible |
| 7 | check | full | fail | checklist | — | — | 5 | Classic quality check combo |
| 8 | show | full | struct+flow | walkthrough | — | junior | 5 | Excellent onboarding combo |
| 9 | probe | full | cross+time | — | — | — | 4 | cross+time good for distributed tracing |

### Key Findings

**High-scoring combinations (5/5):**
- Seed 4: show + full + assume + team — clear teaching scenario
- Seed 5: probe + full + cross + melody + sync — distributed coordination analysis
- Seed 7: check + full + fail + checklist — quality assurance
- Seed 8: show + full + struct + flow + walkthrough + junior — onboarding
- Seed 10: make + full + act + recipe + code — implementation guide

**Cross token (R-01) appearing:**
- Seed 1: cross + minimal + spike
- Seed 5: cross + melody (distributed coordination)
- Seed 9: cross + time (distributed tracing)

**Working well:** cross combines naturally with method tokens (melody, time)

**Slight tensions (4/5):**
- Seed 1: cross + minimal tension
- Seed 2: skim (light) + domains (comprehensive) slight mismatch
- Seed 3: product lens on failures — valid but niche
- Seed 6: sim + codetour — unusual delivery for simulation
- Seed 9: no form/channel makes it less structured

### Observations

1. **`cross` token working well** — Appears in 3/10 shuffles, combines naturally
2. **No major conflicts** — All combinations at least usable (score ≥ 4)
3. **Teaching scenarios strong** — Seeds 4, 8 show excellent pedagogical combos
4. **Quality check patterns solid** — Seed 7 validates check + fail + checklist
