    "Completeness (\"deep\"): The response goes into substantial depth within the chosen scope, unpacking reasoning layers and fine details without necessarily enumerating every edge case.",
    "Scope (\"good\"): The response focuses on how quality, success, or goodness is judged—criteria, metrics, standards, values, or taste—assuming a framing rather than defining it or shifting perspective.",
    "Method (\"verify\"): The response enhances the task by applying falsification pressure to claims, requiring causal chain integrity, externally imposed constraints, and explicitly defined negative space. Claims that fail any axis are treated as ungrounded and must not be synthesized into conclusions or recommendations, ensuring outputs do not transfer authority or imply trust beyond the model. This prevents internally coherent but unconstrained narratives and preserves human oversight as the source of judgment.",
