  "task": "Task:\n  The response changes the form or presentation of given content while keeping its intended meaning. Note: in bar's grammar, `fix` is a reformat task, not a debugging task. For work that involves correcting defects or errors, use `make` or `show` paired with diagnostic method tokens (`diagnose`, `inversion`, `adversarial`).",
  "constraints": [
    "Completeness (\"full\"): The response provides a thorough answer for normal use, covering all major aspects without needing every micro-detail.",
    "Method (\"mod\"): The response enhances the task by applying modulo-style reasoning—equivalence classes, cyclic patterns, quotient structures, or periodic behavior that repeats with a defined period or wraps around boundaries.",
    "Form (\"contextualise\"): The response structures ideas by adding or reshaping context to support another operation—such as supplying background for an LLM or reframing content—without rewriting the main text itself.",
    "Channel (\"gherkin\"): The response outputs only Gherkin format as the complete output, using Jira markup where appropriate and omitting surrounding explanation. Appropriate for tasks that map naturally to scenario-based behavior specification: `check` for acceptance criteria, `plan` for BDD-style feature planning, `make` when defining system behavior. Not appropriate for tasks that don't involve system behavior: `sort`, `sim`, `probe`, `diff` (without behavioral subject).",
    "Directional (\"fip ong\"): The response modifies the task to alternate between abstract principles and concrete examples, then identifies actions to take and extends them to related situations."
