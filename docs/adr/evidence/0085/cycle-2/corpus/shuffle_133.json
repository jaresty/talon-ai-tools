Best paired with `fix`, `pull`, `diff`, or `show` tasks that supply existing content to transform. Pairing with `make` is semantically incoherent: `make` implies creating from nothing while `rewrite` implies transforming existing content.",

Appropriate for tasks that map naturally to scenario-based behavior specification: `check` for acceptance criteria, `plan` for BDD-style feature planning, `make` when defining system behavior. Not appropriate for tasks that don't involve system behavior: `sort`, `sim`, `probe`, `diff` (without behavioral subject)."
