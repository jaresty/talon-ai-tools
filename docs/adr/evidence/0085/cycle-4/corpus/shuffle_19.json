    "Completeness (\"deep\"): The response goes into substantial depth within the chosen scope, unpacking reasoning layers and fine details without necessarily enumerating every edge case.",
    "Method (\"robust\"): The response enhances the task by reasoning under deep uncertainty, favoring options that perform acceptably across many plausible futures rather than optimizing for a single forecast.",
    "Form (\"scaffold\"): The response explains with scaffolding: it starts from first principles, introduces ideas gradually, uses concrete examples and analogies, and revisits key points so a beginner can follow and retain the concepts. Most effective with learning-oriented audiences (`teach_junior_dev`, junior engineer, student). May conflict with senior executive or expert personas (`executive_brief`, CEO audience) where first-principles exposition contradicts expected expertise."
