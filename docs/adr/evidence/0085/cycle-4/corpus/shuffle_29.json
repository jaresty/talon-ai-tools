  "constraints": [
    "Completeness (\"max\"): The response is as exhaustive as reasonable, covering essentially everything relevant and treating omissions as errors.",
    "Scope (\"view\"): The response focuses on how the subject appears from a specific stakeholder, role, or positional perspective, making that viewpoint explicit without asserting it as definitive, evaluating outcomes, or prescribing action.",
    "Method (\"verify\"): The response enhances the task by applying falsification pressure to claims, requiring causal chain integrity, externally imposed constraints, and explicitly defined negative space. Claims that fail any axis are treated as ungrounded and must not be synthesized into conclusions or recommendations, ensuring outputs do not transfer authority or imply trust beyond the model. This prevents internally coherent but unconstrained narratives and preserves human oversight as the source of judgment.",
    "Form (\"quiz\"): The response organizes content as a quiz structure — questions posed before explanations, testing understanding through active recall before providing answers. Without an output-exclusive channel, conducts this as an interactive exchange: poses questions, waits for responses, then clarifies or deepens. With an output-exclusive channel, structures the output itself as a quiz — question headings with revealed answers, test sections, knowledge checks — without requiring live interaction.",
    "Channel (\"presenterm\"): The response is a valid multi-slide presenterm deck expressed as raw Markdown (no code fences). The front matter always matches: \"--- newline title: \u003cdescriptive title based on the input with colons encoded as \u0026#58; and angle brackets encoded as \u0026lt; and \u0026gt;\u003e newline author: Generated (or authors: [...]) newline date: YYYY-MM-DD newline --- newline\" with no other keys. The deck contains up to 12 slides. Each slide starts with a Setext header (title line followed by a line of ---), includes content and references, and ends with an HTML comment named end_slide on its own line followed by a blank line; the final slide may omit the closing end_slide. A blank line always precedes the References section so that a line with \"References\" or \"- References\" is separated by one empty line. Directives appear only as standalone HTML comments with exact syntax: \"\u003c!-- end_slide --\u003e\", \"\u003c!-- pause --\u003e\", \"\u003c!-- column_layout: [7, 3] --\u003e\", \"\u003c!-- column: 0 --\u003e\", \"\u003c!-- reset_layout --\u003e\", and \"\u003c!-- jump_to_middle --\u003e\". Code fence safety is enforced: whenever a fenced code block opens (for example ```mermaid +render, ```bash +exec, ```latex +render, ```d2 +render), the response includes a matching closing fence of exactly three backticks on its own line before any non-code content, directive, or end_slide; if a fence remains open at slide end, the response emits the closing fence first. Mermaid diagrams use code blocks tagged mermaid +render; LaTeX uses latex +render; D2 uses d2 +render; executable snippets use fenced code blocks whose info string starts with a language then +exec (optionally +id:\u003cname\u003e) or +exec_replace or +image. The response emits \"\u003c!-- snippet_output: name --\u003e\" only when a snippet with +id:name exists. Lines hidden with # or /// prefixes follow language conventions; other code blocks appear only when relevant and include the language name; images appear only when valid paths or URLs exist. Within the slide body (outside fenced or inline code and outside HTML directives), the deck never includes raw HTML: every literal '\u003c' becomes \u0026lt; and every literal '\u003e' becomes \u0026gt;, preventing raw angle brackets in body text. Markdown safety prevents accidental styling: standalone or path-embedded '~' becomes \"\u0026#126;\" (so \"~/foo\" becomes \"\u0026#126;/foo\") while intentional \"~~text~~\" remains unchanged. Mermaid safety keeps grammar and delimiters intact ([], (), [[]], (()), [/ /]); node and edge labels appear inside ASCII double quotes and use Mermaid-compatible numeric codes with no leading ampersand, such as \"#91;\" for \"[\", \"#93;\" for \"]\", \"#40;\" for \"(\", \"#41;\" for \")\", \"#123;\" for \"{{\", \"#125;\" for \"}}\", \"#60;\" for \"\u003c\", \"#62;\" for \"\u003e\", \"#35;\" for \"#\", \"#58;\" for \":\", and \"\u0026\" and slashes '/' remain as-is, with no additional entity encodings, and labels are never double-encoded. The deck avoids # headers in slide bodies.",
    "Directional (\"fip rog\"): The response modifies the task to move between abstract principles and concrete examples while examining structural patterns and reflecting on what they reveal."
