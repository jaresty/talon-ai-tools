Implementations must satisfy the prior definition and are not permitted to redefine correctness during construction, shifting progress from building artifacts to securing meaning.",

Without an output-exclusive channel, conducts this as an interactive exchange: poses questions, waits for responses, then clarifies or deepens. With an output-exclusive channel, structures the output itself as a quiz — question headings with revealed answers, test sections, knowledge checks — without requiring live interaction.",
