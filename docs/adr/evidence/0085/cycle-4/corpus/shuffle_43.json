    "Method (\"order\"): The response enhances the task by applying abstract structural reasoning such as hierarchy, dominance, or recurrence. When paired with `sort` task, `order` adds emphasis on the criteria and scheme driving the sequencing rather than merely producing the sorted result — consider whether the distinction is needed.",
    "Form (\"taxonomy\"): The response organizes the main content as a classification system, type hierarchy, or category taxonomy, defining types, their relationships, and distinguishing attributes clearly. Adapts to the channel: when combined with a code channel, the taxonomy is expressed through the type system (interfaces, enums, inheritance hierarchies); with a markup channel, as hierarchical markup structure; without a channel, as prose classification sections.",
