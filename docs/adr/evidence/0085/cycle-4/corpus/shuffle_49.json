  "task": "Task:\n  The response changes the form or presentation of given content while keeping its intended meaning. Note: in bar's grammar, `fix` is a reformat task, not a debugging task. For work that involves correcting defects or errors, use `make` or `show` paired with diagnostic method tokens (`diagnose`, `inversion`, `adversarial`).",
  "constraints": [
    "Completeness (\"deep\"): The response goes into substantial depth within the chosen scope, unpacking reasoning layers and fine details without necessarily enumerating every edge case.",
    "Scope (\"fail\"): The response focuses on breakdowns, stress, uncertainty, or limits by examining how and under what conditions something stops working—risks, edge cases, fragility, or failure modes rather than overall quality or preferred outcomes.",
    "Method (\"robust\"): The response enhances the task by reasoning under deep uncertainty, favoring options that perform acceptably across many plausible futures rather than optimizing for a single forecast.",
    "Form (\"taxonomy\"): The response organizes the main content as a classification system, type hierarchy, or category taxonomy, defining types, their relationships, and distinguishing attributes clearly. Adapts to the channel: when combined with a code channel, the taxonomy is expressed through the type system (interfaces, enums, inheritance hierarchies); with a markup channel, as hierarchical markup structure; without a channel, as prose classification sections.",
    "Channel (\"diagram\"): The response converts the input into Mermaid diagram code only: it infers the best diagram type for the task and respects Mermaid safety constraints (Mermaid diagrams do not allow parentheses in the syntax or raw '|' characters inside node labels; the text uses numeric encodings such as \"#124;\" for '|' instead of raw problematic characters).",
    "Directional (\"fig\"): The response modifies the task to alternate between abstract principles and concrete examples, using each to illuminate the other (figure-ground reversal)."
