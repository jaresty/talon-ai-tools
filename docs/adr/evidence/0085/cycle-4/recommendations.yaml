# Cycle-4 Recommendations YAML

- id: R-01
  action: remove
  token: entertain
  axis: intent
  reason: Creates awkward combinations more often than good ones. When paired with task tokens (make, sort, check), produces semantically unclear prompts.
  evidence:
    - seed_10
    - seed_34
  proposed: Remove from grammar. Users wanting engagement should use specific persona presets (fun_mode, designer_to_pm).

- id: R-02

  target: bar help llm
  section: Composition Rules
  proposed: |
    Add General Guidance section:
    "More tokens does not equal better prompts. The clearest prompts often use fewer tokens.
    Prefer 2-4 tokens for straightforward tasks; 5+ tokens only when the task genuinely requires
    multiple dimensions."

- id: R-04
  action: edit
  target: Token-level guidance (prompt-grammar.json)
  tokens: [designer_to_pm, product_manager_to_team, peer_engineer_explanation, scientist_to_analyst]
  proposed: |
    Add "Strong pairs" to each persona token's guidance:
    - designer_to_pm + sim → Stability analysis, design reviews
    - product_manager_to_team + probe → Quality analysis, retrospectives
    - peer_engineer_explanation + sim → Technical scenarios, walkthroughs
    - scientist_to_analyst + check → Evidence-based verification
