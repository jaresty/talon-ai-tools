The response must use valid D2 syntax and only documented D2 shapes (e.g., rectangle, circle, cylinder, diamond, hexagon, cloud, text). To create visually distinct boxes, use 'border-radius' or style attributes instead of non-existent shapes like 'rounded' or 'note'. Explanatory or note-like content must be modeled using shape: text or a styled standard shape. Do not include any surrounding natural language or commentary. Ensure the output is syntactically correct and compiles successfully with the D2 CLI.",
