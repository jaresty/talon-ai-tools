**Tokens selected:**
- static: diff
- completeness: max
- scope: stable
- method: inversion
- form: (none)
- channel: (none)
- directional: (none)
- persona: as hacker

**Generated prompt preview:**
> Task: The response compares two or more subjects, highlighting relationships such as similarities, differences, or tradeoffs.
> Completeness ("max"): The response is as exhaustive as reasonable...
> Scope ("stable"): The response focuses on equilibrium, persistence, and self-reinforcing states...
> Method ("inversion"): The response flips assumptions, perspectives, or constraints to reframe the problem...

**Scores (vs Prompt Key):**
- Task clarity: 4 - Diff is clear, but "max" makes it very demanding
- Constraint independence: 4 - stable + inversion work together (stability analysis through reframing)
- Persona coherence: 4 - as hacker + diff + inversion is coherent (security/threat modeling style)
- Category alignment: 4 - method=inversion is appropriate for diff
- Combination harmony: 3 - max + inversion could conflict - inversion seeks novel views while max seeks exhaustiveness
- **Overall**: 3

**Meta-Evaluation (vs Bar Skills):**
- Skill alignment: 4
- Skill discoverability: 4
- Heuristic coverage: 3 - max + inversion combo not commonly documented
- Documentation completeness: 4
- **Meta overall**: 4

**Bar Help LLM Reference Evaluation:**
- Cheat sheet utility: 4
- Description clarity: 4
- Selection guidance: 3 - Guidance for combining exhaustive + inversion not clear
- Pattern examples: 3
- **Reference overall**: 3

**Notes:**
Interesting tension: max (exhaustive) + inversion (flip perspective) - they could work together (exhaustively explore inversions) or fight (inversion seeks brevity through reframing while max seeks completeness). This is a good example of the shuffle surfacing a potential tension.

**Skill Feedback:**
- [ ] Catalog issue: max + inversion combo not well covered in usage patterns

**Help LLM Feedback:**
- [ ] Help gap: Could add guidance on combining exhaustive completeness with perspective-flipping methods

**Recommendations:**
- [ ] None - this is a valid tension worth observing
