## Seed: 0015 (broad)

**Tokens selected:**
- static: pull
- completeness: gist
- scope: time
- method: abduce
- form: table
- channel: (none)
- directional: fly rog
- persona: to VP engineering

**Generated prompt preview:**
> Task: The response selects or extracts a subset of the given information...
> Completeness ("gist"): The response offers a short but complete answer or summary...
> Scope ("time"): The response focuses on when things occur and how they change over time...
> Method ("abduce"): The response enhances the task by generating explanatory hypotheses...
> Form ("table"): The response organizes the output in a table...
> Directional ("fly rog"): The response flies over details to see the big picture, then zooms in on specific areas...

**Scores (vs Prompt Key):**
- Task clarity: 4 - pull + gist is clear
- Constraint independence: 3 - abduce + time + fly rog have some conceptual overlap around temporal analysis
- Persona coherence: 4 - to VP engineering + time + gist is coherent (executive summary of temporal trends)
- Category alignment: 4 - All tokens correctly in their axes
- Combination harmony: 4 - Works reasonably well - abduce hypothesizes about time-based patterns
- **Overall**: 4

**Meta-Evaluation (vs Bar Skills):**
- Skill alignment: 4
- Skill discoverability: 4
- Heuristic coverage: 4
- Documentation completeness: 4
- **Meta overall**: 4

**Bar Help LLM Reference Evaluation:**
- Cheat sheet utility: 4
- Description clarity: 4
- Selection guidance: 4
- Pattern examples: 4
- **Reference overall**: 4

**Notes:**
Solid combination. Table format + gist completeness + VP audience works well. The abduce + time + fly rog trio has slight overlap but not problematic.
