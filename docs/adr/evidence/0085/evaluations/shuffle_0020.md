- persona: as domain expert

**Generated prompt preview:**
> Task: The response proposes steps, structure, or strategy to move from the current state toward a stated goal.
> Completeness ("deep"): The response goes into substantial depth within the chosen scope...
> Scope ("act"): The response focuses on what is being done or intended—tasks, activities, operations, or work to be performed...
> Method ("adversarial"): The response enhances the task by actively challenging assumptions, exploring failure modes, and stress-testing proposed solutions...
