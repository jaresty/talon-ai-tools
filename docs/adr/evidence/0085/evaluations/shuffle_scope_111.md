## Seed: 0111 (scope deep-dive)

**Tokens selected:**
- static: make
- completeness: skim
- scope: thing
- method: actors
- form: contextualise
- channel: (none)
- directional: rog
- persona: designer_to_pm (preset)

**Generated prompt preview:**
> Task: The response creates new content that did not previously exist...
> Completeness ("skim"): The response performs only a very light pass...
> Scope ("thing"): The response focuses on what entities are in view...
> Method ("actors"): The response enhances the task by identifying and centering people, roles, or agents...
> Form ("contextualise"): The response structures ideas by adding or reshaping context...
> Directional ("rog"): The response examines the structure of the subject, then reflects on why that structure exists...

**Scores (vs Prompt Key):**
- Task clarity: 4 - make is clear
- Constraint independence: 3 - thing + actors have conceptual overlap (both about entities)
- Persona coherence: 4 - designer_to_pm works for entity-focused creation
- Category alignment: 4 - All tokens in correct axes
- Combination harmony: 3 - Many tokens (thing, actors, contextualise, rog) all about adding perspective/context - could feel repetitive
- **Overall**: 3

**Meta-Evaluation (vs Bar Skills):**
- Skill alignment: 3
- Skill discoverability: 3
- Heuristic coverage: 3
- Documentation completeness: 3
- **Meta overall**: 3

**Bar Help LLM Reference Evaluation:**
- Cheat sheet utility: 3
- Description clarity: 4
- Selection guidance: 3
- Pattern examples: 3
- **Reference overall**: 3

**Notes:**
Slight redundancy in this combination: thing (scope) + actors (method) + contextualise (form) + rog (directional) all add perspective/context to the task. Not a broken combination, but could feel "heavy" with too many framing tokens.

**Skill Feedback:**
- [ ] Catalog issue: contextualise description is complex and may confuse users about when to use it

**Help LLM Feedback:**
- [ ] None identified

**Recommendations:**
- [ ] None
