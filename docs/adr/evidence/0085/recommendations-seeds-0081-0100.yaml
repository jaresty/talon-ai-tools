# ── R8: Extend prose-form conflict list to interactive forms ──────────────────
- id: R8
  action: edit
  tokens: [cocreate, quiz, facilitate]
  axis: form
  reason: >
    cocreate(form) (seed 0082, cocreate+svg=2) and quiz(form) (seed 0085, quiz+presenterm=2)
    are interactive/dialogue forms that require back-and-forth exchange and are therefore
    incompatible with any output-exclusive static channel (svg, presenterm, code, html,
    shellscript). facilitate(form) may have the same issue when paired with code-only
    channels. These extend the prose-form + code-channel conflict class first documented
    in ADR-0105, which listed case/formats/walkthrough/scaffold but missed interactive forms.
  evidence: [seed_0082, seed_0085]
  proposed: >
    Add to each description: "Note: this is an interactive/dialogue form — it requires
    back-and-forth exchange and conflicts with output-exclusive static channels (svg, code,
    html, shellscript, presenterm). Use only with channels that support natural language
    (jira, slack, sketch, plain, remote, sync, or no channel)."
    Additionally, add cocreate, quiz, and facilitate to the § Incompatibilities
    "Prose-form conflicts" list in bar help llm.

# ── R9: Add adr channel to task-affinity restrictions ─────────────────────────
- id: R9
  action: edit
  token: adr
  axis: channel
  reason: >
    sort + adr(channel) scored 2/5 (seed 0091). sort produces a ranked/categorized list;
    adr produces a structured decision record (Context, Decision, Consequences). These
    are incompatible output types. The adr channel has implicit task-affinity for
    decision-making tasks (plan, probe, make) and conflicts with tasks that produce
    non-decision outputs (sort, pull, diff). This extends the task-affinity pattern
    documented for codetour and gherkin in ADR-0105 D2.
  evidence: [seed_0091]
  proposed: >
    Add to adr channel description: "Most appropriate with decision-making tasks:
    `plan` (planning decisions), `probe` (analysis leading to architectural decisions),
    `make` (creating decision records). Avoid with tasks that produce non-decision
    outputs — `sort` (ordered list), `pull` (extraction), `diff` (comparison) —
    as these do not map naturally to the Context/Decision/Consequences structure."
    Also add to bar help llm § Incompatibilities § Task-affinity restrictions:
    "`adr` channel: task-affinity for plan/probe/make; conflicts with sort/pull/diff."

# ── R10: Document sim + facilitate combination guidance ───────────────────────
- id: R10
  action: edit
  token: facilitate
  axis: form
  reason: >
    sim + facilitate(form) produced a recurring 3/5 pattern across 2 seeds (0084, 0093),
    10% of the cycle 5 corpus. sim assumes the LLM performs the scenario playback directly;
    facilitate(form) assumes the LLM structures others in doing the work. The combination
    is usable but creates genuine ambiguity about the LLM's role. Users need guidance
    to set intent clearly.
  evidence: [seed_0084, seed_0093]
  proposed: >
    Add to facilitate(form) description: "When combined with `sim`, the response should
    be understood as designing a facilitation structure for a simulation exercise (who
    does what, in what sequence, what the facilitator manages), not as the LLM directly
    performing the simulation. If you want the LLM to play out the scenario directly,
    omit facilitate."

# ── R11: Document scaffold(form) as educational context token ─────────────────
- id: R11
  action: edit
  token: scaffold
  axis: form
  reason: >
    scaffold(form) + executive_brief persona (probe+scaffold+CEO, seed 0092) scored 3/5
    due to audience mismatch: scaffolding "from first principles" is a beginner-oriented
    teaching approach, but executive_brief addresses a CEO. This is a persona-form
    semantic incompatibility distinct from output-exclusive conflicts.
  evidence: [seed_0092]
  proposed: >
    Add to scaffold(form) description: "Most effective when paired with educational or
    learning-oriented personas (teach_junior_dev, mentor, student audience). May feel
    mismatched when paired with senior executive personas (CEO, executive_brief) where
    first-principles scaffolding contradicts the expected expertise level."

# ── R12: Document bug(form) context-affinity and channel conflicts ─────────────
- id: R12
  action: edit
  token: bug
  axis: form
  reason: >
    bug(form) + sync(channel) scored 2/5 (seed 0099, bug+sync=conflict). bug(form)
    structures output as a static bug report (Steps to Reproduce, Expected Behavior,
    Actual Behavior, Environment); sync(channel) requires a live session plan/agenda.
    These are incompatible output structures. Additionally, bug(form) has strong
    debugging semantic associations — when paired with non-debugging tasks (fix-as-reformat),
    it creates friction even when the task description clarifies the reformat meaning.
  evidence: [seed_0099]
  proposed: >
    Add to bug(form) description: "Strongest with diagnostic and debugging tasks
    (`probe`, `make` paired with diagnostic methods like `diagnose`, `inversion`,
    `adversarial`). May create semantic confusion when paired with `fix` (which is a
    reformat task in bar's grammar, not a debugging task). Conflicts with session-plan
    channels (`sync`) — bug report is a static document, not a live session structure."

# ── R13: Confirm R6 (fix task clarification) as implemented ───────────────────
- id: R13
  action: close
  ref: R6
  reason: >
    seed 0099 confirms the fix task description now includes the disambiguation note:
    "Note: in bar's grammar, `fix` is a reformat task, not a debugging task. For work
    that involves correcting defects or errors, use `make` or `show` paired with
    diagnostic method tokens (`diagnose`, `inversion`, `adversarial`)." R6 is complete.
  evidence: [seed_0099]

# ── Priority summary ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
priority:
  high:   [R8, R9]   # extend incompatibility documentation — prevents known conflict patterns
  medium: [R10, R12] # form token guidance — clarifies ambiguous combinations
  low:    [R11]      # persona-form mismatch note — educational value but lower urgency
  close:  [R13]      # confirms R6 complete
