+## Work Log
+
+### Cycle 1 — 2026-02-13
+
+**Scope**: 30-task taxonomy covering code, analysis, writing, planning, and design domains.
+
+**Evidence artifacts**: `docs/adr/evidence/0113/`
+
+**Coverage result**: 77% well-served (score 4–5), 23% gapped (score ≤3), 1 known out-of-scope.
+
+**Gaps found**:
+
+| ID | Type | Description |
+|----|------|-------------|
+| G-01 | missing-token | No scope token for cross-cutting concerns |
+| G-02 | undiscoverable-token | `inversion` not surfaced for architecture evaluation |
+| G-03 | undiscoverable-token | `actors` not surfaced for security threat modelling |
+| G-04 | skill-guidance-wrong | Risk tasks: probe vs pull disambiguation missing |
+| G-05 | skill-guidance-wrong | `scaffold` form wrongly applied to design artifact tasks |
+| G-06 | skill-guidance-wrong | Summarisation should route to `pull`, not `show` |
+| G-07 | skill-guidance-wrong | Test tasks need create (make) vs evaluate (check) disambiguation |
+| G-08 | skill-guidance-wrong | Pre-mortem technique has no usage pattern |
+| G-09 | out-of-scope | Multi-turn brainstorming not representable by bar |
+| SF-01 | tooling | Persona token slug inconsistency (`audience=to-product-manager` rejected) |
+| SF-02 | false-positive | `case` form apparent hang was bar reading stdin (not a bug) |
+
+**Applied**:
+- `lib/axisConfig.py`: Added `cross` scope token; added guidance for `inversion` and `actors`
+- `make bar-grammar-update`: Regenerated `internal/barcli/embed/prompt-grammar.json`
+- `internal/barcli/help_llm.go`: Added 6 usage patterns (Risk Extraction, Summarisation, Test Coverage Gap Analysis, Test Plan Creation, Pre-mortem/Inversion); updated scaffold heuristic exclusion; added `cross` to scope heuristics; added scope note on single-turn boundary
+- `internal/barcli/build.go`: Fixed persona token slug resolution — `audience=to-product-manager` now accepted, normalised to canonical `to product manager`
+
+**Recommendations not applied**:
+- R-09 out-of-scope note: Added to `bar help llm` scope note section (applied via help_llm.go)
+- R-11 case form: Not a bug — bar reads stdin when no `--subject` provided; no fix needed
