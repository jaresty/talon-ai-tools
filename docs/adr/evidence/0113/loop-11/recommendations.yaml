# ADR-0113 Loop-11 Recommendations
# Date: 2026-02-18
# Focus: Completeness axis discoverability (Part B — gist, skim, narrow)
# Part A (channel post-apply validation) confirmed all 4 loop-10 fixes landed — no new recs needed.

- id: R-L11-01
  gap: G-L11-01
  gap_type: undiscoverable-token
  axis: completeness
  token: gist
  action: add-use-when
  severity: High
  proposed_use_when: >
    Brief but complete response needed: 'quick summary', 'high-level overview',
    'standup update', 'tldr', 'main points only', 'brief but complete', 'overview'.
    Heuristic: 'quick overview', 'brief summary', 'just the key points',
    'tldr', 'standup', 'overview' → gist completeness.
    Prefer gist over skim when completeness matters (gist = brief + complete);
    prefer skim when the user wants a light pass over a larger set (review context).
  evidence:
    - task_T196 (quick overview → full instead of gist)
    - task_T200 (standup brief → full instead of gist)

- id: R-L11-02
  gap: G-L11-02
  gap_type: undiscoverable-token
  axis: completeness
  token: skim
  action: add-use-when
  severity: Medium
  proposed_use_when: >
    Light, surface-level review needed: 'light review', 'quick pass', 'just obvious
    issues', 'spot check', 'surface-level look', 'sanity check'.
    Heuristic: 'skim', 'spot check', 'quick review', 'just flag obvious problems',
    'surface-level' → skim completeness.
    Distinct from gist (gist = brief but complete; skim = light pass, may miss non-obvious).
  evidence:
    - task_T200 (no heuristic distinguishes skim from gist for "brief" tasks)

- id: R-L11-03
  gap: G-L11-03
  gap_type: undiscoverable-token
  axis: completeness
  token: narrow
  action: add-use-when
  severity: Low
  proposed_use_when: >
    Response should focus on a very specific slice only: 'just X and nothing else',
    'only about Y', 'restricted to Z', 'specifically', 'don't go beyond'.
    Heuristic: 'specifically', 'only', 'just this part', 'restricted to',
    'nothing beyond' → narrow completeness.
    Distinct from minimal (minimal = smallest satisfying answer; narrow = very small slice of topic).
  evidence:
    - No task evaluated; inferred from token description analysis
