# ADR-0113 Loop-12 Recommendations
# Date: 2026-02-18
# Focus: Scope axis discoverability — 6 undiscoverable tokens
# Part A (completeness post-apply validation) confirmed loop-11 fixes landed — no new recs.

- id: R-L12-01
  gap: G-L12-01
  gap_type: undiscoverable-token
  axis: scope
  token: time
  action: add-use-when
  severity: Medium
  proposed_use_when: >
    Temporal or sequential focus: user asks about sequence, history, phases, or
    how something changes over time. Heuristic: 'step by step', 'in order',
    'over time', 'what happens when', 'sequence', 'timeline', 'history',
    'how did we get here', 'phases' → time scope. Distinct from flow method
    (flow = reasoning approach; time = scope dimension to emphasize).
  evidence:
    - task_T204 (request flow through system — time scope missed by flow method)

- id: R-L12-02
  gap: G-L12-02
  gap_type: undiscoverable-token
  axis: scope
  token: agent
  action: add-use-when
  severity: High
  proposed_use_when: >
    Decision-making or agency focus: user asks who can act, who has authority,
    or how choices are made between actors. Heuristic: 'who decides', 'who has
    authority', 'who can approve', 'decision-making', 'agency', 'who is
    responsible' → agent scope. Note: agent is a SCOPE token (foregrounds
    decision-making actors); actors is a METHOD token (enriches any task with
    actor-centered analysis). Both can be selected together.
  evidence:
    - task_T205 (who has decision-making authority — agent scope missed, actors method used)

- id: R-L12-03
  gap: G-L12-03
  gap_type: undiscoverable-token
  axis: scope
  token: assume
  action: add-use-when
  severity: Medium
  proposed_use_when: >
    Assumptions and premises focus: user asks what must be true, what is taken
    for granted, or what preconditions are embedded in the design. Heuristic:
    'what assumptions', 'what are we assuming', 'what must be true',
    'what preconditions', 'hidden assumptions', 'what are we taking for granted' →
    assume scope. Distinct from unknowns method (unknowns = surfaces what we
    don't know we don't know; assume = makes explicit what is already assumed).
  evidence:
    - task_T206 (design assumptions about traffic — assume scope not guaranteed)

- id: R-L12-04
  gap: G-L12-04
  gap_type: undiscoverable-token
  axis: scope
  token: motifs
  action: add-use-when
  severity: High
  proposed_use_when: >
    Recurring or repeated patterns across the codebase or system: user asks
    about structures, idioms, or patterns that appear in multiple places.
    Heuristic: 'recurring patterns', 'repeated across', 'appears in multiple
    places', 'common idioms', 'what keeps showing up', 'same pattern in
    different places' → motifs scope. Distinct from struct (one system's
    internal arrangement) and mapping method (surface all elements/relationships).
  evidence:
    - task_T207 (recurring error-handling patterns — motifs missed, mapping used)

- id: R-L12-05
  gap: G-L12-05
  gap_type: undiscoverable-token
  axis: scope
  token: good
  action: add-use-when
  severity: Medium
  proposed_use_when: >
    Quality criteria or success standards focus: user asks what makes something
    good, what criteria matter, or how to judge quality. Heuristic: 'quality
    criteria', 'what makes it good', 'how to judge', 'success criteria',
    'well-designed', 'what good looks like', 'standards for', 'what does
    success look like' → good scope. Often pairs with fail scope (good + fail =
    both quality and failure mode dimensions).
  evidence:
    - task_T208 (API quality criteria — good scope not reliably selected)

- id: R-L12-06
  gap: G-L12-06
  gap_type: undiscoverable-token
  axis: scope
  token: stable
  action: add-use-when
  severity: Medium
  proposed_use_when: >
    Stability and persistence focus: user asks what is stable, unlikely to
    change, or self-reinforcing in the system or design. Heuristic: 'stable',
    'unlikely to change', 'won't change', 'what persists', 'what is settled',
    'fixed constraints', 'what has remained stable', 'backward-compatible' →
    stable scope. Often pairs with time scope (stable = what persists;
    time = how things evolve).
  evidence:
    - task_T210 (stable vs. evolving API contract — stable scope missed)
