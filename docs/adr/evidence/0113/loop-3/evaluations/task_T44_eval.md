## Task: T44 — Compare two refactoring approaches (NEW — Test `compare` in code context)

**Domain:** Code  
**Focus:** Test `compare` for code-level decisions  
**Task Description:** "Should we refactor incrementally or do a big-bang rewrite?"

### Skill Selection Log

**Task Analysis:**
- Code refactoring comparison
- Process/methodology comparison (not just technical)
- Risk/time factors involved

**Token Selection:**
- **Task:** `probe` (analyze tradeoffs)
- **Completeness:** `full` (comprehensive comparison)
- **Scope:** `delta` (changes) + `time` (timeline) + `fail` (risks)
- **Method:** `compare` (compare approaches)
- **Form:** `checklist` (decision factors)
- **Channel:** `plain` (prose)
- **Persona:** (none)

**Bar command constructed:**
```bash
bar build probe full delta time fail compare checklist plain
```

### Coverage Scores

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Token fitness | 5 | `compare+delta+time+fail` captures refactoring decision factors |
| Token completeness | 5 | Changes, timeline, and risks all covered |
| Skill correctness | 5 | Correctly applied compare to code decision |
| Prompt clarity | 5 | Clear methodology comparison |
| **Overall** | **5** | **Excellent.** |

### Gap Diagnosis

**Gap type:** none  
**Notes:** `compare` works across domains — architecture (T41), design (T42), infrastructure (T43), and code (T44). Token is domain-agnostic as intended.
