**Domain:** Reliability Engineering  
**Focus:** Chaos engineering methodology  
**Task Description:** "Design chaos engineering experiments for our payment service"

---

### Skill Selection Log

**Task Analysis:**
- Experimental design task
- Chaos = intentional failure injection
- Testing resilience

**Token Selection:**
- **Task:** `make` (design experiments)
- **Completeness:** `full` (comprehensive experiments)
- **Scope:** `fail` (failure modes) + `act` (actions to take)
- **Method:** `experimental` (experimental design method)
  - *Perfect match!*
- **Form:** `checklist` (experiment checklist)
- **Channel:** `plain` (document)
- **Persona:** (none)

**Bar command constructed:**
```bash
bar build make full fail act experimental checklist plain
```

### Coverage Scores

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Token fitness | 5 | `fail+act+experimental` perfect for chaos engineering |
| Token completeness | 5 | All dimensions covered |
| Skill correctness | 5 | Correctly surfaced experimental method |
| Prompt clarity | 5 | Clear experimental design |
| **Overall** | **5** | **Excellent — specialized domain well-covered.** |
