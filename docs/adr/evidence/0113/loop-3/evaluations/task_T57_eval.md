### Skill Selection Log

**Task Analysis:**
- Architecture decision document
- Technical audience
- RFC format

**Token Selection:**
- **Task:** `make` (create RFC)
- **Completeness:** `full` (comprehensive RFC)
- **Scope:** `delta` (changes) + `good` (benefits) + `assume` (assumptions)
- **Method:** `argue` (structured argument for change)
- **Form:** (none — adr channel handles structure)
- **Channel:** `adr` (architecture decision record format)
- **Persona:** `to-engineering-lead` (decision audience)

**Bar command constructed:**
```bash
bar build make full delta good assume argue adr to-engineering-lead
```

### Coverage Scores

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Token fitness | 5 | `argue+adr` perfect for RFC format |
| Token completeness | 5 | Changes, benefits, assumptions all covered |
| Skill correctness | 5 | Correctly selected adr channel |
| Prompt clarity | 5 | Clear architecture decision document |
| **Overall** | **5** | **Excellent — adr channel working well.** |

### Gap Diagnosis

**Gap type:** none  
**Notes:** `adr` channel provides RFC structure. `argue` method adds persuasive reasoning. Good coverage for architecture decision documents.
