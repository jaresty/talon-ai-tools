## Findings Comparison

| Finding | ADR-0085 (Shuffle) | ADR-0113 (Task) | Correlation |
|---------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Token: entertain | Remove — creates awkward combos | Not evaluated | **Single-process signal** — shuffle found it, task doesn't use it |
| Token limits | Add guidance — fewer tokens = better | Not specifically evaluated | **Aligned** — both value simplicity |
| Persona-task pairs | Add to token guidance | Not specifically evaluated | **Aligned** — task analysis confirmed strong pairs work |
| Token: cross | Not in shuffle findings | Added in loop-1 | **Task-only signal** — task analysis found gap shuffle missed |
| Token: inversion | Not in shuffle findings | Undiscoverable for architecture eval | **Task-only signal** — task analysis found gap shuffle missed |

## Detailed Correlation

### ADR-0085 Findings

| ID | Action | Target | Evidence |
|----|--------|--------|----------|
| R-01 | Remove | `entertain` intent | seed_10, seed_34 — awkward combos |
| R-02 | Add guidance | bar help llm | High-fill scored lower than low-fill |
| R-04 | Add to guidance | Persona-task pairs | Highest-scoring prompts had strong persona-task alignment |

### ADR-0113 Findings

| ID | Type | Finding | Status |
|----|------|---------|--------|
| G-01 | Missing token | `cross` scope token | ✅ Added |
| G-02 | Undiscoverable | `inversion` for architecture | 🔄 Skill guidance updated |
| G-03 | Missing token | Risk extraction pattern | 🔄 Skill guidance updated |
| Loop-5 | Coverage validation | Scope descriptions working | ✅ Confirmed |

## Analysis

### Confirmed (both processes agree)

- **Token simplicity matters** — ADR-0085: high-fill (10 tokens) scored lower. ADR-0113: simple tasks with 2-4 tokens work well.
- **Persona-task alignment is crucial** — Both found strong pairs produce better outcomes.

### ADR-0085-only signals

- **`entertain` removal** — Shuffle evaluation found it creates awkward combinations. Not present in task analysis because tasks don't naturally reach for "entertain."

### ADR-0113-only signals

- **`cross` scope token** — Task analysis found a gap shuffle missed. Added to grammar (loop-1).
- **`inversion` discoverability** — Task analysis found skill guidance didn't surface it for architecture evaluation.

### Contradictions

None found. Each process found issues the other missed, but no contradictions.

## Conclusion

| Correlation | Count |
|-------------|-------|
| Confirmed (both agree) | 2 |
| Aligned (related, same root cause) | 1 |
| Single-process (one found) | 2 |
| Contradictory | 0 |

**Verdict:** Processes are complementary, not contradictory. ADR-0085 finds catalog-level coherence issues; ADR-0113 finds task-level coverage gaps.

**Next steps:**
- ADR-0085 R-01, R-02, R-04 ✅ Applied
- ADR-0113 G-01 ✅ Applied  
- ADR-0113 G-02 🔄 Skill update in progress

No conflicts — proceed with both sets of recommendations.
