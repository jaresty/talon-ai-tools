      "channel": {
        "codetour": "The response is a valid VS Code CodeTour `.tour` JSON document (schema-compatible) that uses steps and fields appropriate to the task and omits extra prose or surrounding explanation.",
        "diagram": "The response converts the input into Mermaid diagram code only: it infers the best diagram type for the task and respects Mermaid safety constraints (Mermaid diagrams do not allow parentheses in the syntax or raw '|' characters inside node labels; the text uses numeric encodings such as \"#124;\" for '|' instead of raw problematic characters).",
        "html": "The response consists solely of semantic HTML for the answer, with no surrounding prose.",
        "jira": "The response formats the content using Jira markup (headings, lists, panels) where relevant and avoids extra explanation beyond the main material.",
        "presenterm": "The response is a valid multi-slide presenterm deck expressed as raw Markdown (no code fences). The front matter always matches: \"--- newline title: <descriptive title based on the input with colons encoded as &#58; and angle brackets encoded as &lt; and &gt;> newline author: Generated (or authors: [...]) newline date: YYYY-MM-DD newline --- newline\" with no other keys. The deck contains up to 12 slides. Each slide starts with a Setext header (title line followed by a line of ---), includes content and references, and ends with an HTML comment named end_slide on its own line followed by a blank line; the final slide may omit the closing end_slide. A blank line always precedes the References section so that a line with \"References\" or \"- References\" is separated by one empty line. Directives appear only as standalone HTML comments with exact syntax: \"<!-- end_slide -->\", \"<!-- pause -->\", \"<!-- column_layout: [7, 3] -->\", \"<!-- column: 0 -->\", \"<!-- reset_layout -->\", and \"<!-- jump_to_middle -->\". Code fence safety is enforced: whenever a fenced code block opens (for example ```mermaid +render, ```bash +exec, ```latex +render, ```d2 +render), the response includes a matching closing fence of exactly three backticks on its own line before any non-code content, directive, or end_slide; if a fence remains open at slide end, the response emits the closing fence first. Mermaid diagrams use code blocks tagged mermaid +render; LaTeX uses latex +render; D2 uses d2 +render; executable snippets use fenced code blocks whose info string starts with a language then +exec (optionally +id:<name>) or +exec_replace or +image. The response emits \"<!-- snippet_output: name -->\" only when a snippet with +id:name exists. Lines hidden with # or /// prefixes follow language conventions; other code blocks appear only when relevant and include the language name; images appear only when valid paths or URLs exist. Within the slide body (outside fenced or inline code and outside HTML directives), the deck never includes raw HTML: every literal '<' becomes &lt; and every literal '>' becomes &gt;, preventing raw angle brackets in body text. Markdown safety prevents accidental styling: standalone or path-embedded '~' becomes \"&#126;\" (so \"~/foo\" becomes \"&#126;/foo\") while intentional \"~~text~~\" remains unchanged. Mermaid safety keeps grammar and delimiters intact ([], (), [[]], (()), [/ /]); node and edge labels appear inside ASCII double quotes and use Mermaid-compatible numeric codes with no leading ampersand, such as \"#91;\" for \"[\", \"#93;\" for \"]\", \"#40;\" for \"(\", \"#41;\" for \")\", \"#123;\" for \"{{\", \"#125;\" for \"}}\", \"#60;\" for \"<\", \"#62;\" for \">\", \"#35;\" for \"#\", \"#58;\" for \":\", and \"#124;\" for \"|\". Internal double quotes escape as \"\". Ampersands \"&\" and slashes '/' remain as-is, with no additional entity encodings, and labels are never double-encoded. The deck avoids # headers in slide bodies.",
